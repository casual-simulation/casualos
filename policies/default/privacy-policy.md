<h2 id="information-we-collect-from-children">Information We Collect From Children</h2>

Our services are intended for users of all ages.
All users are able to access the static version of the services. If you access Our services, You will be able to create an Experience Generation Gizmo or ‘egg’ for short. This is similar to creating a document in Microsoft Word and anything you create will only be saved locally to Your device.
If You would like to create an Instance or “inst”, which is a collaborative version of the egg and works more similarly to a Google Doc in which many users can be invited to participate, We will ask You to create an account on Our services.
Before creating an account, We will ask You to provide Your date of birth. If You are under the age of 18 years old We will require full verifiable parental consent. We will collect a parent email address to seek consent.
We work with PRIVO to obtain consent and verify parents. PRIVO is a leading privacy solutions expert as well as an FTC approved COPPA Safe Harbor. All information collected for verification is stored securely and not used for any other purpose. For more information on PRIVO please see [here](https://www.privo.com/platform-privacy-policy).
Parents can choose to allow children to publish eggs or create collaborative insts.
There are infinite options for what anyone can do with their egg or inst, and this includes sharing or processing all types of personal information. For example, if a user decides to create or add sound or voice sampling, a user’s voice and anything they say will be publicly available. Some insts may also include a map that collects and processes location based on an IP address.

<h2 id="use-in-schools-and-museums">Use In Schools And Museums</h2>

From time to time, We at Casual Simulation may demo Our services in a school or at a museum to a group of students. If You are accessing Our services via a live demo, We will ask You, a parent/guardian or a school to provide consent for participation in the services. The school will provide consent through a signed agreement. Any eggs or insts created in live sessions will either only be static versions as described above, or any insts will only be open to other students participating in the same session.

<h2 id="cached-data">Cached Data</h2>

<h2 id="data-retention">Data Retention</h2>

If you do not create an account, we will not collect or store any data from your egg and it will only be saved locally to your device. If you have created an account in order to save your eggs and insts, we will store these for as long as necessary to provide the service. If your account is inactive for 12 months (i.e. you have not logged in during that period), we will flag the account and delete all collected information, including records, data, files, insts and other directly associated data, within 30 days of setting the flag.

If you would like to request to access, view, modify or delete your or your child’s information, please contact us at [hello@casualsimulation.org](mailto:hello@casualsimulation.org).
