Community guidelines are crucial for maintaining a positive and safe online community. Here’s why they’re important:

-   **Promotes Respectful Interaction**: We aim to foster polite and helpful conversations. This makes our platform friendly for sharing thoughts.
-   **Protecting Users**: We want to provide a safe environment for users of all ages. This means we have rules on what kinds of things can be shared.
-   **Legal Compliance**: We follow necessary laws. This not only avoids legal issues but also builds trust with users.
-   **Enhancing User Experience**: Guidelines encourage positive interactions and content creation. This, in turn, improves user experience.

Community guidelines are key to a lively online community. They encourage positive connections and collaboration. We offer a place to boost creativity, knowledge, and skills. Feeling safe, respected, and involved in a community makes you more likely to stay. We want you to enjoy your time on our platform.

Let’s talk about what you’ll need to know to make that happen. We call this document our “code of conduct”. It is where we put rules and guidelines on how we want people to use our website. It answers questions like “what can I share?” and “what should I do if someone isn’t following the rules?”
Here are a few guidelines we would like you to follow:

Be smart about what you share. We want you to be mindful of what you are creating and sharing. There is a lot of personal information you wouldn’t share with a stranger in the real world, so you shouldn’t share it online.

Here are some examples of what not to share:

-   **Identifiable information**: full names, home addresses (even if it’s city or neighborhood), birthdates, phone numbers, or school information (name or class schedule) could compromise your safety and impose risks.
    -   **Social Security Number**: This is highly sensitive information that should not be shared online with anyone.
    -   **Financial Information**: Please do not give out any credit card numbers or bank account details.
-   **Passwords**: We want all accounts belonging to you to stay secure. Do not post or share a password on the site for anything (medical, game, family accounts).
-   **Photos & Videos**: Sharing photos or videos can reveal identity, location, identifiable landmarks and other personal details.

This is what we would love you to share:

-   **Interests, hobbies, educational content** (knowledge of what you are learning)
-   **Creative works** (share your paintings, music, poems, stories)
-   **Positive experiences, funny memes & Jokes, CUTE ANIMAL PHOTOS!**

Be aware that when creating software there are some risks. Email us at [hello@casualsimulation.com](mailto:hello@casualsimulation.com) if you want to create something but you are unsure if it is safe to create (e.g. using a voice mixer to mash up voices).
