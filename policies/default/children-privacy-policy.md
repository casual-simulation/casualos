### Who are we?

We are Casual Simulation and we make websites for children.

Our offices are in Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States of America.

To make our websites work and for you to use them we need to collect some information.

### What is a privacy policy?

A privacy policy is a notice that tells you who we are and what we do. It tells you all about the information we collect in our websites, how we use it and who we share it with. It also tells you what rights you have over your personal information.

### What is personal information?

Personal Information could be your first name, your email address, your age or other information we ask for. It could also be something that your phone or computer tells us about you, like a unique device ID.

You should always be careful about how you share your information.

### When do we collect your personal information?

We collect your personal information when you create an account on one of our websites.

### What information do we collect?

Information we collect about you on our websites includes your personal information.

Casual Simulation needs to collect the following information on our websites so you can use them:

-   Your first name

-   Your date of birth

-   Your display name

We may sometimes ask for:

-   Your email address

-   Your parent's email address so we can get their permission for you to use the website

We also need to collect some information automatically in our website to make sure they work properly:

This includes:

-   Your computer's IP address

We use this to make sure that the website is working.

We only keep your information as long as we need it to provide you with the website.

### Do we share your information?

We sometimes need some help to build and run our app and when we do we work with other companies who can support us.

These companies are called third parties or service providers and they are not allowed to share your information with anyone.

We work with these companies to provide our websites:

-   [PRIVO](https://www.privo.com/privacy-information-for-kids)

-   [Amazon](https://aws.amazon.com/privacy)

-   [Cockroach Labs](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/privacy/)

-   [Redis](https://redis.com/legal/privacy-policy/)

If you or your parent would like more information on how these companies use your information you can contact us here: <privacy@casualsimulation.org>

We will only use your or your parent's email address to answer your questions and then we will delete it.

### Keeping your information safe

It's important to keep any information we collect safe and secure. We do our best to make sure we use all the right tools and measures to keep your information as safe as possible.

You have rights:

#### 1\. Right to be informed

Companies must tell you what information they collect from you and why. This allows you or your parent to make the appropriate choice.

#### 2\. Right of Access

You have the right to know how your personal information is being used. If it is shared with another company and how it is kept safe.

#### 3\. Right to Rectification

This means that you have the right to correct your personal information if something is wrong.

#### 4\. Right to Erasure

This allows you to request that a company deletes all information they have about you and really forgets who you are.

#### 5\. Right to Restrict Processing

You are in control and you might agree to your personal information being used for one thing but not for another.

#### 6\. Right to Data Portability

You can ask for your personal information to be sent to another service if you want to use that instead.

#### 7\. Right to Object

You can request that a company stops processing your personal information at any time. You can always just say no.

### Making changes

Sometimes we need to make some changes in our websites. If we do and they include changes to the way we might collect or use your information, we will post a notice to tell you at the top of this page.
