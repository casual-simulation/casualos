/**
 * Events are our way of letting you know when something interesting happens in
 * your account. When an interesting event occurs, we create a new `Event`
 * object. For example, when a charge succeeds, we create a `charge.succeeded`
 * event; and when an invoice payment attempt fails, we create an
 * `invoice.payment_failed` event. Note that many API requests may cause multiple
 * events to be created. For example, if you create a new subscription for a
 * customer, you will receive both a `customer.subscription.created` event and a
 * `charge.succeeded` event.
 *
 * Events occur when the state of another API resource changes. The state of that
 * resource at the time of the change is embedded in the event's data field. For
 * example, a `charge.succeeded` event will contain a charge, and an
 * `invoice.payment_failed` event will contain an invoice.
 *
 * As with other API resources, you can use endpoints to retrieve an
 * [individual event](https://stripe.com/docs/api#retrieve_event) or a [list of events](https://stripe.com/docs/api#list_events)
 * from the API. We also have a separate
 * [webhooks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook) system for sending the
 * `Event` objects directly to an endpoint on your server. Webhooks are managed
 * in your
 * [account settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/webhooks),
 * and our [Using Webhooks](https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks) guide will help you get set up.
 *
 * When using [Connect](https://stripe.com/docs/connect), you can also receive notifications of
 * events that occur in connected accounts. For these events, there will be an
 * additional `account` attribute in the received `Event` object.
 *
 * **NOTE:** Right now, access to events through the [Retrieve Event API](https://stripe.com/docs/api#retrieve_event) is
 * guaranteed only for 30 days.
