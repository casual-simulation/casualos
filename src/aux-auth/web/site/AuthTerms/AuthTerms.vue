                        arbitration for any claims covered by this agreement to arbitrate.

                        person&rsquo;s account, if we are a party to the proceeding. This dispute
                        resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and not
                        by any state law concerning arbitration. In the event JAMS, INC. is
                        unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160)
                        days of filing the case, then either we or you can elect to have the
                        arbitration administered instead by the American Arbitration Association.
                        Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court
                        having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law
                        notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages,
                        remedies, or awards that conflict with these Terms of Service. You agree
                        that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of
                        action arising out of, related to or connected with the use of the Services
                        must be filed within one (1) year after such claim of action arose or be
                        forever banned.

                    <p>
                        You agree that, notwithstanding anything in the foregoing, any arbitration
                        proceeding between you and us will be conducted in Kent County, Grand
                        Rapids, Michigan, and that the language of the arbitration shall be in
                        English, and that all arbitration proceedings shall be considered
                        confidential in nature.

                        notices or rejections of future changes to this section), you may reject any

                        properly opted out within the first thirty (30) days after you first
                        accepted the provisions in this section. If you have not properly opted out,
                        then by rejecting a future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate
                        any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this section, as
                        modified by any changes you did not reject. A notification sent pursuant to

                        entered into other arbitration or dispute resolution agreements with us or
