/**
 * Defines a class that represents a Quaternion. That is, a representation of a 3D rotation.
 *
 * Quaternions are a mathematical representation of 3D transformations and are commonly used to calculate and apply rotations to 3D points.
 * They work by defining a quaterion such that `q = w + x*i + y*j + z*k`, where `w, x, y, and z` are real numbers and `i, j, and k` are imaginary numbers.
 * The basics of this is that `x`, `y`, and `z` define a vector that represents the rotation axis, and `w` defines an angle around which the rotation occurs.
 * However, because `i`, `j`, and `k` are included we can keep `x`, `y`, and `z` from incorrectly interacting with each other and so avoid common pitfalls like Gimbal lock.
 *
 * One little known feature of quaternions is that they can also represent reflections and also scale.
 * This is because there are two different ways to apply a quaternion to a 3D point:
 *
 * - `quaterion * point * inverse(quaterion)`
 *
 * This formula rotates and scales the point quaternion. The rotation occurs around the axis specified by the quaternion X, Y, and Z values.
 * Additionally, the point will be scaled by the length of the quaternion. (i.e. `sqrt( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2 )`)
 * This is why quaternions that are used to represent only rotations must be normalized.
 *
 * - `quaternion * point * quaternion`
 *
 * This formula reflects scales the point by the quaternion. The reflection occurs across the axis specified by the quaternion X, Y, and Z values.
 * Additionally, the point will be scaled by the length of the quaternion. (i.e. `sqrt( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2 )`)
