/**
 * A DateTime is an immutable data structure representing a specific date and time and accompanying methods.
 * It contains class and instance methods for creating, parsing, interrogating, transforming, and formatting them.
 *
 * A DateTime comprises of:
 * * A timestamp. Each DateTime instance refers to a specific millisecond of the Unix epoch.
 * * A time zone. Each instance is considered in the context of a specific zone (by default the local system's zone).
 * * Configuration properties that effect how output strings are formatted, such as `locale`, `numberingSystem`, and `outputCalendar`.
 *
 * Here is a brief overview of the most commonly used functionality it provides:
 *
 * * **Creation**: To create a DateTime from its components, use one of its factory class methods: {@link DateTime.local}, {@link DateTime.utc}, and (most flexibly) {@link DateTime.fromObject}.
 * To create one from a standard string format, use {@link DateTime.fromISO}, {@link DateTime.fromHTTP}, and {@link DateTime.fromRFC2822}.
 * To create one from a custom string format, use {@link DateTime.fromFormat}. To create one from a native JS date, use {@link DateTime.fromJSDate}.
 * * **Gregorian calendar and time**: To examine the Gregorian properties of a DateTime individually (i.e as opposed to collectively through {@link DateTime#toObject}), use the {@link DateTime#year},
 * {@link DateTime#month}, {@link DateTime#day}, {@link DateTime#hour}, {@link DateTime#minute}, {@link DateTime#second}, {@link DateTime#millisecond} accessors.
 * * **Week calendar**: For ISO week calendar attributes, see the {@link DateTime#weekYear}, {@link DateTime#weekNumber}, and {@link DateTime#weekday} accessors.
 * * **Configuration** See the {@link DateTime#locale} and {@link DateTime#numberingSystem} accessors.
 * * **Transformation**: To transform the DateTime into other DateTimes, use {@link DateTime#set}, {@link DateTime#reconfigure}, {@link DateTime#setZone}, {@link DateTime#setLocale},
 * {@link DateTime.plus}, {@link DateTime#minus}, {@link DateTime#endOf}, {@link DateTime#startOf}, {@link DateTime#toUTC}, and {@link DateTime#toLocal}.
 * * **Output**: To convert the DateTime to other representations, use the {@link DateTime#toRelative}, {@link DateTime#toRelativeCalendar}, {@link DateTime#toJSON}, {@link DateTime#toISO},
 * {@link DateTime#toHTTP}, {@link DateTime#toObject}, {@link DateTime#toRFC2822}, {@link DateTime#toString}, {@link DateTime#toLocaleString}, {@link DateTime#toFormat},
 * {@link DateTime#toMillis} and {@link DateTime#toJSDate}.
 *
 * There's plenty others documented below. In addition, for more information on subtler topics
 * like internationalization, time zones, alternative calendars, validity, and so on, see the external documentation.

     * A DateTime is an immutable data structure representing a specific date and time and accompanying methods.
     * It contains class and instance methods for creating, parsing, interrogating, transforming, and formatting them.
     *
     * A DateTime comprises of:
     * * A timestamp. Each DateTime instance refers to a specific millisecond of the Unix epoch.
     * * A time zone. Each instance is considered in the context of a specific zone (by default the local system's zone).
     * * Configuration properties that effect how output strings are formatted, such as `locale`, `numberingSystem`, and `outputCalendar`.
     *
     * Here is a brief overview of the most commonly used functionality it provides:
     *
     * * **Creation**: To create a DateTime from its components, use one of its factory class methods: {@link DateTimeClass.local}, {@link DateTimeClass.utc}, and (most flexibly) {@link DateTimeClass.fromObject}.
     * To create one from a standard string format, use {@link DateTimeClass.fromISO}, {@link DateTimeClass.fromHTTP}, and {@link DateTimeClass.fromRFC2822}.
     * To create one from a custom string format, use {@link DateTimeClass.fromFormat}. To create one from a native JS date, use {@link DateTimeClass.fromJSDate}.
     * * **Gregorian calendar and time**: To examine the Gregorian properties of a DateTimeClass individually (i.e as opposed to collectively through {@link DateTimeClass#toObject}), use the {@link DateTimeClass#year},
     * {@link DateTimeClass#month}, {@link DateTimeClass#day}, {@link DateTimeClass#hour}, {@link DateTimeClass#minute}, {@link DateTimeClass#second}, {@link DateTimeClass#millisecond} accessors.
     * * **Week calendar**: For ISO week calendar attributes, see the {@link DateTimeClass#weekYear}, {@link DateTimeClass#weekNumber}, and {@link DateTimeClass#weekday} accessors.
     * * **Configuration** See the {@link DateTimeClass#locale} and {@link DateTimeClass#numberingSystem} accessors.
     * * **Transformation**: To transform the DateTimeClass into other DateTimeClasss, use {@link DateTimeClass#set}, {@link DateTimeClass#reconfigure}, {@link DateTimeClass#setZone}, {@link DateTimeClass#setLocale},
     * {@link DateTimeClass.plus}, {@link DateTimeClass#minus}, {@link DateTimeClass#endOf}, {@link DateTimeClass#startOf}, {@link DateTimeClass#toUTC}, and {@link DateTimeClass#toLocal}.
     * * **Output**: To convert the DateTimeClass to other representations, use the {@link DateTimeClass#toRelative}, {@link DateTimeClass#toRelativeCalendar}, {@link DateTimeClass#toJSON}, {@link DateTimeClass#toISO},
     * {@link DateTimeClass#toHTTP}, {@link DateTimeClass#toObject}, {@link DateTimeClass#toRFC2822}, {@link DateTimeClass#toString}, {@link DateTimeClass#toLocaleString}, {@link DateTimeClass#toFormat},
     * {@link DateTimeClass#toMillis} and {@link DateTimeClass#toJSDate}.
     *
     * There's plenty others documented below. In addition, for more information on subtler topics
     * like internationalization, time zones, alternative calendars, validity, and so on, see the external documentation.
