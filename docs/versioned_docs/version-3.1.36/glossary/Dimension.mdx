Dimensions are the names of [tags](#tag) that are used by [bots](#bot) in the [instance](#instance).
They are most commonly used by portals to show only some of the bots in the instance in the portal.

For example if you have three bots and two of them have the `#home=true` tag,
you can use the `home` dimension with a portal to show only the bots that have the `#home=true` tag.
