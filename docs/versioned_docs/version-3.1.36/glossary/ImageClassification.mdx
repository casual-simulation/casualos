**Image Classification** is a technique that tries to calculate how likely a given image is to fit into each of the given categories.
For example, you may want to know if a particular image most looks like a Banana or an Orange. Image Classification can be used to help answer this problem.

Image classification in CasualOS utilizes [Machine Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) via a tool called [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/).
Additionally, CasualOS only supports image classification via the camera(s) on your device.

As a result, the technique is split into two parts:

1. Manual data collection and model training.
2. Automated categorization of images based on the trained model.

#### Data Collection and Training

In order to automatically classify images, we need to generate an efficient description of what our categories look like. This is called "model training".
Ideally, we only need to train a model once and then we can re-use it forever.

> In CasualOS, we do that by using [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) to create an image model.

We can gather a bunch of images and manually categorize them.
Then we can "train" a model on those images to produce a model which is a description of what our categories look like. (i.e. a model could be trained to contain a description of what a banana looks like)

#### Using the trained model

Once we have a model, we can tell CasualOS to process the camera feed and classify each image with it.

> It is possible to run an image model with the <ActionLink action='os.openImageClassifier(options)'/> function.

Following the above description, we can do image classification in CasualOS:

1.  To create a model, go to [https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) and click "Get Started".
2.  Create an "Image Project" and choose "Standard Image Model".
3.  Add or record photos in each class.
4.  Click "Train".
5.  Once training is done you can get a model URL by clicking "Export Model".
6.  Under "Tensorflow.js", choose "Upload (shareable link)" and click "Upload". You can also optionally save the project to Google Drive.
7.  Once uploaded, copy the shareable link.
8.  Create a bot with an `@onClick` tag and put the following code in it (replacing `MY_MODEL_URL` with the shareable link):
    ```typescript
    await os.openImageClassifier({
        modelUrl: "MY_MODEL_URL"
    });
    ```
