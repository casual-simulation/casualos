A Event Record is a way to track how many times a particular action/event occurred and is stored in a <GlossaryRef term='record'>record</GlossaryRef> and is accessed by a name.
Every event record starts with a count of 0 and can be incremented by using <ActionLink action='os.recordEvent(recordKey, eventName)'/> and the current count can be accessed with
<ActionLink action='os.countEvents(recordNameOrKey, eventName)'/>.

Event records are most useful for basic analytics.
