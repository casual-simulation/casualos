A server is a computer or set of computers that are configured to make a website available over the [internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet).
For CasualOS, the term "server" can be an easy way to refer to a particular deployment of CasualOS.

There are several different CasualOS servers, and they are configured for different use cases.
For example common servers support synchronizing inst data across multiple devices, while static servers do not.
You can find an incomplete list of servers below.

#### Common

Common servers support all the features CasualOS is known for: scripting, records, and multi-device collaboration.
Each common CasualOS server can host many <GlossaryRef term='instance'>instances</GlossaryRef>.

Additionally, common servers are updated immediately whenever a new release is published to the [CasualOS GitHub repository](https://github.com/casual-simulation/casualos) by the development team.

#### Static

Static servers support all CasualOS features except multi-device collaboration.
This makes them useful for canned experiences that would be too expensive to make on common servers.

#### Stable

Stable servers support all CasualOS features just like common servers.
The only difference from common servers is that stable servers are updated one week after common servers.
This can make it easier to catch bugs introduced by newer versions of CasualOS.

#### Alpha

Alpha servers support all CasualOS features just like common servers.
The only difference from common servers is that they are updated to test features before they are released to the public.
This makes it easier for the CasualOS development team to catch bugs and test features before the common servers are updated.
