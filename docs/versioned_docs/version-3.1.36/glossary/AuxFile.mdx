_AUX commonly stands for **A**utomatic **U**ser **E**xperience but it can also stand for **A**mbient **U**ser **E**xperience._

AUX (pronounced "awks") is a term that we use to talk about an computer system that provides access to an interactive model for multiple people across multiple devices and geographic locations.
This means that AUXes are designed to work on a wide variety of devices (phones, laptops, VR headsets, etc.), and they remain synced regardless of where in the world you are.

With respect to CasualOS, every [inst](#instance) is an AUX because CasualOS does the hard work to ensure that everything is synced and works across all connected devices.

You may also come across the term "AUX File". AUX files are files that use the `.aux` filename extension and contain [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) formatted data which represents a set of bots and their tags.

AUX Files come in two different versions:

-   Version 1
    -   Version 1 AUX Files contain a snapshot of a set of bots as pure JSON.
        They are most useful for when you would like to save and reload the exact state of bots or when you would like to export bot data to an external system.
-   Version 2
    -   Version 2 AUX Files contain a set of [conflict-free](https://crdt.tech/) updates to a set of bots as base64 encoded strings embedded in JSON.
        They are most useful for when you would like to ensure the initialization of a shared [inst](#instance) doesn't run into issues with duplicated data or when you want to manually share a set of changes offline.

Usually, AUX files are utilized as an easy way to save/load [bots](#bot) from an inst.
