A Data Record is a piece of information that is stored in a <GlossaryRef term='record'>record</GlossaryRef> and is accessed by an address.
Data records can be overwritten with new information and can only store up to 300KB of data.

Data records are most useful for storing relatively lightweight information that can change over time.
