In CasualOS, Vectors are useful objects that represent 2D/3D positions and directions.
They are called vectors because in Math it is common to call an ordered list of numbers a "vector".

Additionally, they are useful because we can use vectors to represent X, Y, and Z positions and perform common operations on them like adding them together or finding the distance between them.
When saved to tags, vectors are stored as [vector tags](/tags#vector-tags).

There are two classes that provide vector functionality:

-   [`Vector2`](#Vector2) provides 2D vectors.
-   [`Vector3`](#Vector3) provides 3D vectors.
