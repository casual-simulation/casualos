Listen tags are tags that can receive shouts and whispers from other bots and actions that happen from the user.
To create a listen tag, you make a normal tag and enter a "@" as the first character of the tag's value.

Each listen tag has some predefined variables that can be used. You can read about those [here](./variables.mdx).

## Whisper Tags

### `@onModDrop`

A whisper that is sent to a bot that a mod was dropped on.
If a custom `@onModDrop` is not specified, then the mod will be applied automatically.
If a custom `@onModDrop` is specified, then the mod needs to be applied manually via <ActionLink action='applyMod(bot, ...mods)'/>.

Unlike <TagLink tag='@onCreate'/>, this listen tag is triggered whenever the bot as been added to the current player's server, even if the bot has already been created.
An example of this happening is when you first load a server. Even though all the bots have already been created, they still need to be added to the server in order for you to interact with them.

Note that this listen tag is triggered after any pending scripts have finished running. This means that if a script updates the same tag multiple times, `@onBotChanged` will still only be triggered once.

  to: string,
};
```

### `@[groupName][stateName]OnExit`

```

### `@onAnyBotsAdded`

A shout that is sent when a list of bots is added to the current server.

Unlike <TagLink tag='@onAnyCreate'/>, this listen tag is triggered whenever the bots have been added to the current player's server, even if the bots have already been created.
An example of this happening is when you first load a server. Even though all the bots have already been created, they still need to be added to the server in order for you to interact with them.

Note that this listen tag is triggered after any pending scripts have finished running. This means that if a script creates multiple bots, `@onAnyBotsAdded` will only be triggered once.

     */
    bots: Bot[];

An example of this happening is when another player disconnects. Even though their config bots were not destroyed, they still need to be removed from the server.

Note that this listen tag is triggered after any pending scripts have finished running. This means that if a script deletes multiple bots, `@onAnyBotsRemoved` will only be triggered once.

#### Arguments:
```typescript
let that: {
    /**
     * The array of bot IDs that were removed from the server.
     */
    botIDs: string[];
};
```

### `@onAnyBotsChanged`

A shout that is sent when one or more tags are changed on a list of bots in the current server.

This listen tag is triggered whenever the bots have been updated in the current player's server, even if the bots were not updated locally.
An example of this happening is when another player changes a tag in the sheet portal. Even though the change was made on their device, it will show up on the current device.

Note that this listen tag is triggered after any pending scripts have finished running. This means that if a script updates multiple bots, `@onAnyBotsChanged` will only be triggered once.

#### Arguments:
```typescript
let that: {
    /**

### `@onError`

A shout that is sent when an unhandled error occurs in a listen tag.
Errors can occur for many reasons, but common ones include data being unexpectedly missing (e.g. "Cannot read property xyz of undefined") or invalid usage (e.g. "xyz is not a function").

Note that errors which occur in a `@onError` listen tag will not trigger further `onError` calls.
To view those errors, open the developer tools console.

#### Arguments:
```typescript
let that: {
    /**
     * The bot that the error originated from.
     */
    bot: Bot,

    /**
     * The tag that the error originated from.
     */
    tag: string,

    /**
     * The error that occurred.
     */
    error: Error
}
```
