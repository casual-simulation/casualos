## Data Actions

### `create(...mods)`


Creates a new bot or combination of bots with the given mods. Also triggers <TagLink tag='@onCreate'/> on all the created bots.
By default, bots are created with a unique <TagLink tag='id'/>, <TagLink tag='creator'/> set to the current `bot.id`, and <TagLink tag='space'/> set to `shared`.
Bots must be created with at least one tag. If `create()` tries to make a bot with zero tags then an error will be thrown.

If <TagLink tag='creator'/> references a non-existent bot or a bot with a different <TagLink tag='space'/> than the created bot, then <TagLink tag='creator'/> will be set to `null`.

**Each parameter** is a mod that should be applied to the new bot(s).
If no parameters are specified, then the new bot will have its <TagLink tag='creator'/> set to `bot.id` and <TagLink tag='space'/> set to `shared`.
If an array of mods is used for a parameter, then one bot will be created for _each unique combination of mods_.

#### Examples:

```typescript title="Create a red bot"
let myRedBot = create({
    color: "red"
});
```

```typescript title="Create a parent and a child bot"
let myParentBot = create({
    creator: null,
    label: "Parent"
});
let myChildBot = create({
    creator: getID(myParentBot),
    label: "Child"
});
```

```typescript title="Create a red bot in the tempLocal space"
let myBot = create({ space: "tempLocal", color: "red" });
```

```typescript title="Create a bot from multiple mods"
// myBot is placed in the "myDimension" dimension and is colored green
let myBot = create({ myDimension: true }, {
    color: "green"
});
```

```typescript title="Create a red bot and a blue bot"
let [myRedBot, myBlueBot] = create({ creator: null}, [
    {
        "color": "red"
    },
    {
        "color": "blue"
    }
]);
```

### `destroy(bot)`


Removes the given bot, list of bots, or bot by <TagLink tag='id'/> and triggers <TagLink tag='@onDestroy'/> for each of the destroyed bots.

Note that only destroyable bots will be destroyed.
Bots that have <TagLink tag='destroyable'/> set to `false` will not be destroyed.

Also note that all bots that have <TagLink tag='creator'/> set to the <TagLink tag='id'/> of a destroyed bot will also be destroyed (unless they are not destroyable).
This happens recursively until there are no more bots to destroy.

#### Examples:

```typescript title="Destroying a single bot"
// Destroy a single bot that has #name set to "bob"
destroy(getBot("#name", "bob"));
```

```typescript title="Destroying a list of bots"
// Destroy all the bots that have #color set to "red"
destroy(getBots("#color", "red"));
```

```typescript title="Destroying a bot by its id"
// Destroy the bot with the #id: "config"
destroy("config");
```

### `applyMod(bot, ...mods)`


Applies the given mods to the given bot.

The **first parameter** is the bot that the mods should be applied to.

The **other parameters** are the mods that should be applied to the bot. If two mods have the same tag, then the mod that is last in the list will win.

#### Examples

```typescript title='Set the "test" tag and "name" tag on a bot'
applyMod(bot, {
    test: true,
    name: "bob"
});
```

### `subtractMods(bot, ...mods)`


Removes the tags contained in the given mod(s) from the given bot or mod.

The **first parameter** is the bot or mod that the tags should be removed from.

The **other parameters** are the bots or mods that contain the tags which should be removed from the original bot.

#### Examples:

```typescript title="Remove a mod from this bot"
const mod = {
    color: 'red',
    name: 'bob'
};

subtractMods(this, mod);
```

```typescript title="Remove multiple mods from this bot"
subtractMods(this, {
    color: 'red'
}, {
    name: 'bob'
});
```

### `removeTags(bot, tagSection)`


Removes all the tags from the given bot that match the given tag section.

The **first parameter** is the bot or list of bots that should have the tags removed.

The **second parameter** is a string or regex that specifies which tags to remove.
If given a string, then all the tags that start with the given string will be removed.
If given a regex, then all the tags which match the regex will be removed.

#### Examples:

```typescript title='Remove tags starting with "abc" from this bot'
removeTags(this, "abc");
```

```typescript title='Remove tags named "hello" using a case-insensitive regex from this bot'
removeTags(this, /^hello$/gi)
```

### `renameTag(bot, originalTag, newTag)`

Renames the given original tag on the given bot or list of bots to the given new tag.
If the original tag does not exist on the bot, then no changes will take place.
If the new tag already exists on the bot, then it will be overwritten with the contents of the original tag.

The **first parameter** is the bot or list of bots that should have the tag renamed.

The **second parameter** is the name of the tag that should be renamed.

The **third parameter** is the new name that the tag should have.

#### Examples:

```typescript title='Rename the "auxColor" tag to "color"'

```

### `changeState(bot, stateName, groupName?)`

Changes the state that the given bot occupies in the given group.
If the state was changed, then the <TagLink tag='@[groupName][stateName]OnExit'/> and <TagLink tag='@[groupName][stateName]OnEnter'/> whispers are sent to the `bot`.

The **first parameter** is the bot whose state should be changed.

The **second parameter** is the value that should be set on the bot.

The **third parameter** is the name of the tag that should be changed on the bot. If not specified, then the `#state` tag will be used.

#### Examples:

// Triggers @playbackStatePlayingOnEnter
changeState(bot, "Playing", "playbackState");
```

### `getLink(...bots)`

Creates and returns a bot link that references the given bots.
The link can then be stored in a tag to save it.
Useful for creating bot links for an arbitrary number of bots.

**Each parameter** is the bot or bot ID that should be linked to.

#### Examples

```typescript title='Create a link to this bot'
os.toast(getLink(thisBot));
```

### `getBots(..filters)`


Gets an array of bots that match all of the given filter(s). The returned array is sorted alphabetically by the <TagLink tag='id'/> tag.

**Each parameter** is a [bot filter](#bot-filters). If no filters are specified, then all bots in the inst are returned.
If multiple filters are specified, then only the bots that match all of the filters are returned.

#### Examples

```typescript title='Find all bots with the "test" tag'
let bots = getBots(byTag("#test"));

The **first parameter** is the name of the tag. Bots that have this tag will be included as long as they also match the second parameter.

The **second parameter** is the value the tag should match. If not specified, then all bots with the tag will be included.
If specified, then only bots that have the same tag and value will be included. If you specify a function as the value, then it will be used to match tag values.

<Alert type='info'>
    This function behaves exactly like <ActionLink action='getBots(...filters)'/> with <ActionLink action='byTag(tag, value?)' />
</Alert>

#### Examples

If given a bot, then the returned JSON will be able to be able to be converted back into a mod via <ActionLink action='getMod(bot)'/>.

#### Examples

```typescript title='Sort a nicely formatted copy of a bot in a tag'
let bob = getBot("#name", "bob");
tags.savedBot = getFormattedJSON(bob);
```

### `getSnapshot(bots)`

Gets a snapshot of the given bots.
Snapshots are like mods (see <ActionLink action='getMod(bot)'/>) except they contain multiple bots and include the ID, space, tags, and tag masks of the bots.

The **first parameter** is the bot or list of bots that a snapshot should be created out of.

#### Examples

```typescript title='Create a snapshot of thisBot'
const snapshot = getSnapshot(thisBot);
console.log(snapshot);
```

```typescript title='Create a snapshot of all the bots'
const snapshot = getSnapshot(getBots());
console.log(snapshot);
```

### `diffSnapshots(first, second)`

Calculates the difference between the two given snapshots.
The returned value is such that if you were to apply the changes (using <ActionLink action='applyDiffToSnapshot(snapshot, diff)'/>) it represents to the first snapshot you would end up with the second snapshot.

The **first parameter** is the snapshot that should be used as the baseline for the diff.

The **second parameter** is the snapshot that should be used as the target for the diff.

#### Examples

```typescript title='Calculate the diff between two snapshots'
const first = getSnapshot([thisBot]);
thisBot.tags.color = 'red';
const second = getSnapshot([thisBot]);
const diff = diffSnapshots(first, second);

console.log(diff);
```

### `applyDiffToSnapshot(snapshot, diff)`

Applies the given difference to the given snapshot and returns a new snapshot that represents the result.

The **first parameter** is the snapshot that the delta should be applied to. This is also called the baseline snapshot.

The **second parameter** is the delta that should be applied to the snapshot.
You can create a delta from two snapshots by using the <ActionLink action='diffSnapshots(first, second)'/> function.

#### Examples

```typescript title='Calculate a new snapshot from a baseline and diff'
const first = getSnapshot([thisBot]);
const diff = {
    [thisBot.id]: {
        tags: {
            color: 'red'
        }
    }
};
const second = applyDiffToSnapshot(first, diff);

console.log(second);
```

### `getMod(bot)`


Gets a mod for the given bot and list of tags. The returned mod will only contain tags that are contained in the given list.

The **first parameter** is the bot or JSON string that should be cloned into a mod.

The **other parameters** are the tags that should be included in the returned mod.
If no other parameters are specified, then all tags are included.
If a parameter is a RegEx ([Regular Expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions)), then it will include all the tags that match the expression.

#### Examples:

```typescript title='Get a mod with the current bot's tags'
let mod = getMod(bot);
```

```typescript title='Get a mod with only the #color and #label tags'
let mod = getMod(bot, "color", "label");
```

```typescript title='Get a mod with every tag that starts with "on"'
let mod = getMod(bot, /^on/g);
```

### `getBotLinks(bot)`

Gets the list of bot links that are stored in tags on the specified bot.
Returns an array with objects that have the following structure:

```typescript
let result: {
    /**
     * The tag that the link was parsed from.
     */
    tag: string;

    /**
     * The bot IDs that the link references.
     */
    botIDs: string[];
}[];
```

This function can be useful if you want to discover what tags are linking to bots and get those bot IDs.

#### Examples:

```typescript title='Get the list of bot links on this bot'
console.log(getBotLinks(thisBot));
```

### `updateBotLinks(bot, idMap)`

Updates the links in the given bot to point to the new Bot IDs specified in the given ID map.

The **first parameter** is the bot whose links should be updated.

The **second parameter** is an object that maps old bot IDs to the new IDs that should replace them.
Each property should be an old ID and each value should be a new ID.

#### Examples:

```typescript title='Change all references to "botA" to "botB" on thisBot'
updateBotLinks(thisBot, {
    "botA": "botB"
});
```

### `getBotPosition(bot, dimension)`

Gets the 3D position of the given bot in the given dimension.

The **first parameter** is the bot or bot ID whose position should be retrieved.

The **second parameter** is the dimension that the position should be retrieved for.

#### Examples:

```typescript title='Get the position of this bot in the #home dimension'
let position = getBotPosition(thisBot, "home");
```

### `uuid()`

Creates a new UUID. Useful for generating a random identifier that is guaranteed to be unique.

#### Examples:

```typescript title='Generate a new UUID and toast it'
const id = uuid();

os.toast(id);
```

### `DateTime`

DateTime is a class that makes representing, manipulating, and comparing date information easier than what is possible with the normal JavaScript [Date class](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date).
Internally, CasualOS uses a library called [luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/tour) to provide the `DateTime` class to scripts.

When you save a DateTime to a tag, CasualOS will automatically format it so that it is automatically detectable as a date and will always be represented the same no matter where in the world you are.
To do this, CasualOS uses the `📅` emoji as a prefix for date + time values and automatically parses them into DateTime objects.

For example, saving `📅2022-10-03` to the `date` tag will make `tags.date` be a DateTime value that represents midnight on the 3rd of October in 2022 in the UTC-0 time zone.
If you want your date to represend midnight in another time zone, you can add the [IANA time zone](https://nodatime.org/TimeZones) you want to the end of the value.
This is midnight in Tokyo: `📅2022-10-03 Asia/Tokyo`.

See [luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/tour) for more information and examples.

#### Examples:

```typescript title='Toast the current time in the local timezone'
os.toast(DateTime.now());
```

```typescript title='Toast the current time in the UTC-0 timezone'
os.toast(DateTime.utc());
```

```typescript title='Toast a specific time in the local timezone'
os.toast(DateTime.local(2020, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2));
```

```typescript title='Toast a specific time in the UTC-0 timezone'
os.toast(DateTime.utc(2020, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2));
```

```typescript title='Toast the current date in a nicely formated string'
os.toast(DateTime.now().toLocaleString()); // => '2/15/2022'
```

```typescript title='Toast the current date and time in a nicely formated string'
os.toast(DateTime.now().toLocaleString(DateTime.DATETIME_FULL)); // => 'April 20, 2017, 11:32 AM EDT'
```

```typescript title='Toast the current date and time in a nicely formated string'
os.toast(DateTime.now().toLocaleString(DateTime.DATETIME_FULL)); // => 'April 20, 2017, 11:32 AM EDT'
```

```typescript title='Toast a date in a nice relative format to now'
os.toast(DateTime.utc(2021, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2).toRelative()); // => '8 months ago'
```

```typescript title='Compare two dates to each other in hours'
const date1 = DateTime.utc(2021, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2);
const date2 = DateTime.local(2021, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2);
const duration = date1.diff(date2, 'hours');
os.toast(duration.toHuman()); // => '-4 hours'
```

```typescript title='Check if one date is before another date'
const date1 = DateTime.utc(2021, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2);
const date2 = DateTime.local(2021, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2);
const date3 = DateTime.local(2021, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2);

// Is date1 before date2?
os.toast(date1 < date2); // => 'true'

// Is date2 equal to date3?
os.toast(date2.toMillis() === date3.toMillis()); // => 'true'
```

```typescript title='Check if one date has the same month as another date'
const date1 = DateTime.utc(2021, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2);
const date2 = DateTime.local(2021, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2);

os.toast(date1.hasSame(date2, 'month')); // => 'true'
```


### `getDateTime(value)`

Attempts to create a new [DateTime](#datetime) object from the given value.
Returns a DateTime object if successful. Returns null otherwise.

See [DateTime](#datetime) for more information.

The **first parameter** is the value that should be converted into a DateTime.
If it is a string, then CasualOS will attempt to parse the string.
If it is a [Date object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) then it will be converted to a DateTime by assuming the Date represents the local time zone.

## Utility Actions

### `animateTag(bot, tag, options)`

Animates the tag on the given bot based on the specified parameters.
Returns a promise that resolves when the animation is finished and throws an error when the animation is canceled.
This is useful for gradually changing a tag on a bot over time. For example, moving a bot from point A to point B without teleporting it.

<ActionLink action='animateTag(bot, tag, options)'/> is fully integrated with tag masks.
This lets you animate tag values in the `tempLocal`, `local`, `player`, and `shared` spaces.

The **first parameter** is the bot or list of bots that the tag should be animated on.

The **second parameter** is the tag that should be animated.

The **third parameter** are the options that should be used to animate the tag.
If `null` is used, then any active animations for the tag on these bots will be canceled.
It should be an object with the following properties:

```typescript
let options: {

    /**
     * The value that the animation should start at.
     * If omitted, then the current tag value will be used.
     */
    fromValue?: number;

    /**
     * The value that the animation should end at.
     */
    toValue: number;

    /**
     * The number of seconds that the animation should take to complete.
     */
    duration: number;

    /**
     * The space that the tag should be animated in.
     * If not specified, then "tempLocal" will be used.
     * If set to false, then the bot will be edited instead of using tag masks.
     * Additionally, if the specified space is the same as the space the bot lives in
     * then the bot will be edited directly.
     */
    tagMaskSpace?: 'tempLocal' | 'local' | 'tempShared' | 'shared' | false;

    /**
     * The time that the animation should start.
     * Should be the number of miliseconds since January 1st 1970 UTC-0. (e.g. os.localTime or os.agreedUponTime).
     */
    startTime?: number;

    /**
     * The options for easing.
     * Can be an "easing type" or an object that specifies the type and mode.
     * If an easing type is specified, then "inout" mode is used.
     * If omitted, then "linear" "inout" is used.
     * 
     * Can also be a custom function that takes a single parameter and returns a number.
     * The paramater will be a number between 0 and 1 indicating the progress through the tween.
     */
    easing?: 'linear'
            | 'quadratic'
            | 'cubic'
            | 'quartic'
            | 'quintic'
            | 'sinusoidal'
            | 'exponential'
            | 'circular'
            | 'elastic' 
            | ((progress: number) => number)
            | {

            | 'circular'
            | 'elastic';

        /**
         * Whether to apply the easing at the
         * start (in), end (out), or start and end (inout) of the tween.
         */
        mode: 'in' | 'out' | 'inout';
    }
};
```

#### Examples:

1. Animate the `#count` tag from 0 to 1 over 5 seconds.
```typescript
await animateTag(bot, "count", {
    fromValue: 0,
    toValue: 1,
    duration: 5
});

os.toast("Animation finished!");
```

2. Run 2 animations in sequence.
```typescript
await animateTag(bot, "homeX", {
    fromValue: 0,
    toValue: 5,
    duration: 2
});

await animateTag(bot, "homeY", {
    fromValue: 0,
    toValue: 5,
    duration: 2
});
```

3. Run an animation while the `#loop` tag is true.
```typescript
while(tags.loop) {
    await animateTag(bot, "homeX", {
        fromValue: 0,
        toValue: 5,
        duration: 2
    });
}
```

4. Run an animation with a "bouncy" easing mode.
```typescript
await animateTag(bot, "homeX", {
    fromValue: 0,
    toValue: 5,
    duration: 2,
    easing: {
        type: "elastic",
        mode: "out"
    }
});
```

5. Run an animation with a custom easing function that causes the animation to progress in 10 distinct steps.
```typescript
await animateTag(bot, "homeX", {
    fromValue: 0,
    toValue: 5,
    duration: 2,
    easing: (k) => {
        return Math.floor(k * 10) / 10;
    }
});
```

6. Run an animation that starts in 1 second.
```typescript
await animateTag(bot, "homeX", {
    fromValue: 0,
    toValue: 5,
    duration: 2,
    startTime: os.localTime + 1000,
});
```

7. Animate a tag in `tempShared` space.
```typescript
await animateTag(bot, "homeX", {
    fromValue: 0,
    toValue: 5,
    duration: 2,
    tagMaskSpace: 'tempShared'
});
```

8. Cancel animations on the `#homeX` tag.
```typescript
animateTag(bot, "homeX", {
    fromValue: 0,
    toValue: 5,
    duration: 2
}).then(() => {
    os.toast("Animation Finished!");
}).catch(() => {
    os.toast("Animation Canceled!");
});

await os.sleep(500);

animateTag(bot, "homeX", null);
```

### `animateTag(bot, options)`

Animates multiple tags on the given bot based on the specified parameters.

This works similarly to <ActionLink action='animateTag(bot, tag, options)'/> but instead of providing a tag name, you instead provide an object for the `fromValue` and `toValue` options which contains the tags that should be animated.

Returns a promise that resolves when the animation is finished and throws an error when the animation is canceled.
This is useful for gradually changing a set of tags on a bot over time. For example, moving a bot from point A to point B without teleporting it.

Unlike calling <ActionLink action='animateTag(bot, tag, options)'/> multiple times, animations started with this function are grouped together.
This means that canceling one animation in the group will also cancel the others.

This function is fully integrated with tag masks.
This lets you animate tag values in the `tempLocal`, `local`, `player`, and `shared` spaces.

The **first parameter** is the bot or list of bots that the tag should be animated on.

The **second parameter** are the options that should be used to animate the tag.
It should be an object with the following properties:

```typescript
let options: {

    /**
     * The tags values that the animation should start at.
     * Each property should be the name of a tag that should be animated.
     * The values should be the starting values for the tags.
     */
    fromValue: object;

    /**
     * The tag values that the animation should end at.
     * Each property should be the name of a tag that should be animated.
     * The values should be the starting values for the tags.
     */
    toValue: object;

    /**
     * The number of seconds that the animation should take to complete.
     */
    duration: number;

    /**
     * The space that the tag should be animated in.
     * If not specified, then "tempLocal" will be used.
     * If set to false, then the bot will be edited instead of using tag masks.
     * Additionally, if the specified space is the same as the space the bot lives in
     * then the bot will be edited directly.
     */
    tagMaskSpace?: 'tempLocal' | 'local' | 'tempShared' | 'shared' | false;

    /**
     * The options for easing.
     * Can be an "easing type" or an object that specifies the type and mode.
     * If an easing type is specified, then "inout" mode is used.
     * If omitted, then "linear" "inout" is used.
     */
    easing?: 'linear'
            | 'quadratic'
            | 'cubic'
            | 'quartic'
            | 'quintic'
            | 'sinusoidal'
            | 'exponential'
            | 'circular'
            | 'elastic' 
            | {
        /**
         * The type of easing.
        */
        type: 'linear'
            | 'quadratic'
            | 'cubic'
            | 'quartic'
            | 'quintic'
            | 'sinusoidal'
            | 'exponential'
            | 'circular'
            | 'elastic';

        /**
         * Whether to apply the easing at the
         * start (in), end (out), or start and end (inout) of the tween.
         */
        mode: 'in' | 'out' | 'inout';
    }
};
```

#### Examples:

1. Animate the `#homeX` and`#homeY` tags from 0 to 1 over 5 seconds.
```typescript
await animateTag(bot, {
    fromValue: {
        homeX: 0,
        homeY: 0,
    },
    toValue: {
        homeX: 1,
        homeY: 1
    },
    duration: 5
});

os.toast("Animation finished!");
```

2. Animate tags in `tempShared` space.
```typescript
await animateTag(bot, {
    fromValue: {
        homeX: 0,
        homeY: 0,
    },
    toValue: {
        homeX: 5,

```

### `inDimension(dimension)`


Creates a bot filter that includes bots that are in the given dimension. That is, they have the given tag set to `true`.

The **first parameter** is the name of the dimension.

<Alert type='info'>
    This function behaves exactly like <ActionLink action='byTag(tag, value?)' /> with the `value` parameter set to `true`.
</Alert>

#### Examples

1. Find all the bots in the "test" dimension.
```typescript
let bots = getBots(inDimension("test"));
```

### `atPosition(dimension, x, y)`

Creates a bot filter that includes bots that are in the given dimension and at the given X and Y position.

When this filter is used with <ActionLink action='getBots(...filters)'/>, the returned bots are sorted in the same order that they are stacked.
This means that the first bot in the array is at the bottom of the stack and the last bot is at the top of the stack (assuming they're stackable).

The **first parameter** is the name of the dimension.

The **second parameter** is the X position. That is, the left-right position of the bots in the dimension.

The **third parameter** is the Y position. That is, the forward-backward position of the bots in the dimension.

#### Examples

1. Find all the bots at (1, 2) in the "test" dimension.
```typescript
let bots = getBots(atPosition("test", 1, 2));
```

### `inStack(bot, dimension)`

Creates a bot filter that includes bots in the same stack as the given bot. The given bot will always be included by this filter as long the given bot is in the given dimension.

When this filter is used with <ActionLink action='getBots(...filters)'/>, the returned bots are sorted in the same order that they are stacked.
This means that the first bot in the array is at the bottom of the stack and the last bot is at the top of the stack (assuming they're stackable).

The **first parameter** is the bot that other bots should be in the same stack with.

The **second parameter** is the name of the dimension.

#### Examples

1. Find all bots in the same stack as `this` in the "test" dimension.
```typescript
let bots = getBots(inStack(this, "test"));
```

### `byCreator(bot)`


Creates a bot filter that includes bots created by the given bot. That is, they have <TagLink tag='creator' /> set to the <TagLink tag='id' /> of the given bot.

The **first parameter** is the bot that created the other bots.

<Alert type='info'>
    This function behaves exactly like <NormalCode>byTag("creator", getID(bot))</NormalCode>.
</Alert>

#### Examples

1. Find all the bots created by this bot.
```typescript
let bots = getBots(byCreator(this));
```

### `bySpace(space)`

Creates a bot filter that includes bots in the given space. That is, they have <TagLink tag='space'/> set to the given value.

The **first parameter** is the space that the bots are in.

<Alert type='info'>
    This function behaves exactly like <NormalCode>byTag("space", space)</NormalCode>.
</Alert>

The **first parameter** is the bot or mod that the other bots should match.

#### Examples:

1. Find all the bots with `#height` set to `1` and `#color` set to `red`.
```typescript
const bots = getBots(byMod({
    height: 1,
    color: "red"
}));
```

### `neighboring(bot, dimension, direction)`


Creates a bot filter that includes bots which are neighboring the given bot.
Optionally takes a direction that the neighboring bots must be in.

The **first parameter** is the bot that the other bots need to be neighboring.

The **second parameter** is the dimension that the other bots need to be in.

The **third parameter** is optional and is the neighboring direction to check. If not specified, then all of the supported directions will be checked.
Currently, the supported directions are `front`, `right`, `back`, and `left`. If an unsupported direction is specified, then no bots will be included.

#### Examples:

1. Find all bots in front of `this` bot in the `test` dimension.
```typescript
const bots = getBots(neighboring(this, "test", "front"));
```

1. Find all bots around `this` bot in the `test` dimension.
```typescript
const bots = getBots(neighboring(this, "test"));
```

### `either(...filters)`

Creates a bot filter that includes bots which match any (i.e. one or more) of the given filters.

**Each parameter** is a bot filter.

#### Examples:

1. Find all bots with the `#name` `bob` or a `#height` of 2.
```typescript
const bots = getBots(
    either(
        byTag("#name", "bob"),
        byTag("height", 2)
    )
);
```

### `not(filter)`

Creates a function that includes bots which _do not_ match the given filter.

The **first parameter** is the bot filter whose results should be negated.

#### Examples:

1. Find all bots that are not in the `test` dimension.
```typescript
const bots = getBots(not(inDimension("test")));
```

## Event Actions

### `shout(name, arg?)`


Sends a shout to all bots that are <TagLink tag='listening'/> and have a [listen tag][listen-tag] for the specified name. Optionally includes a custom `that` argument.
Also triggers <TagLink tag='@onListen'/> and <TagLink tag='@onAnyListen'/>.

The **first parameter** is the name of the shout. e.g. Using `onClick` for the name will trigger all <TagLink tag='@onClick'/> listeners.

The **second parameter** is the `that` argument to send with the shout. You do not need to specify this parameter if you do not want to.

#### Examples:

1. Send a `@reset` event to all bots:
```typescript
shout("reset");
```

2. Send a `@hello` event with your name:
```typescript
shout("hello", "Bob");
```

### `whisper(bot, name, arg?)`


Sends a whisper to the specified bot(s) that are <TagLink tag='listening'/> and have a [listen tag][listen-tag] for the given name. Optionally includes a custom `that` argument.
Also triggers <TagLink tag='@onListen'/> and <TagLink tag='@onAnyListen'/>.

The **first parameter** is the bot, array of bots, bot <TagLink tag='id'/>, or array of bot <TagLink tag='id'/> that the whisper should be sent to.

The **second parameter** is the name of the whisper. e.g. Using `onClick` for the name will trigger the <TagLink tag='@onClick'/> listener for the specified bots.

The **third parameter** is the `that` argument to send with the shout. You do not need to specify this parameter if you do not want to.

#### Examples:

1. Send a `@reset` event to all bots named `Bob`:
```typescript
let bots = getBots("#name", "Bob");
whisper(bots, "reset");
```

2. Send a `@setColor` event to ourself:
```typescript
whisper(this, "setColor", "red");
```

### `priorityShout(events, arg?)`

Shouts to all bots that are <TagLink tag='listening'/> and have a [listen tag][listen-tag] for the specified events until one of the bots returns a value.
Optionally includes a custom `that` argument. Also triggers <TagLink tag='@onListen'/> and <TagLink tag='@onAnyListen'/> for the bots that the shout was sent to.

This function is useful when you want to shout but only want one bot to process the shout.

The **first parameter** is the array of event names that should be shouted. e.g. Using `onClick` for the name will trigger the <TagLink tag='@onClick'/> listener until a bot returns a value.

#### Examples:

```typescript title='Shout to the first bot that handles @onClick'
priorityShout(['onClick']);
```

```typescript title='Shout to the first bot that handles @myTest or @mySecondTest'
priorityShout(['myTest', 'mySecondTest']);
```

```typescript title='Priority shout with a color'
priorityShout(['myTest', 'mySecondTest'], "blue");
```

### `superShout(name, arg?)`


Sends a shout to all of the other instances that are loaded.

The **first parameter** is the name of the shout. e.g. Using `onClick` for the name will trigger all the <TagLink tag='@onClick'/> listeners.

The **second parameter** is the optional `that` argument to include with the shout.

#### Examples:

1. Send a `hello` super shout to all the loaded instances.
```typescript
superShout("hello");
```

### `remote(action, target?)`

Sends the given action to another remote.

In CasualOS, all actions are messages which are placed in a queue and processed one at at time.

For example, the <ActionLink action='os.toast(message, duration?)'/> action queues a message which, when processed, will show a toast message.
However, before any action is performed, it is run through the <TagLink tag='@onAnyAction'/> listener which can decide whether reject an action using <ActionLink action='action.reject(action)'/>.
This lets you write rules for what actions each player is allowed to take.

There are a couple special cases. First, when you send/receive an action from someone else (i.e. they sent an action to you using the <ActionLink action='remote(action)'/> function), it won't run by default.
Instead it is wrapped as a `device` action and sent to <TagLink tag='@onAnyAction'/> for processing. This lets you decide whether to allow players to send messages to each other and what the effect of those messages are.
If you want to perform the action, you can use <ActionLink action='action.perform(action)'/> on the inner device action to queue it for execution.

The **first parameter** is the action to send.

The **second parameter** is optional and is a object specifing which remote to send the action to. If not specified, then the action is sent to the server.
If specified, then the action is sent to all remotes that match the given values. If given a string, then the action is sent to the remote with the matching ID.

#### Examples:

1. Send a toast message to another remote.
```typescript
// TODO: Get the bot ID of the other remote.
const otherRemoteId = 'otherRemoteId';

// Create a toast action
const toastAction = os.toast('My message!');

// Send the action to the other remote
// The toastAction will not be performed locally because
// it is being sent to another remote.
remote(toastAction, otherRemoteId);
```

### `sendRemoteData(remoteId, name, arg?)`

Sends a <TagLink tag='@onRemoteData'/> shout to the remote with the given ID or remotes if given a list of IDs.
This is useful for sending arbitrary messages to specific remotes.

The **first parameter** is the remote ID or list of remote IDs that the shout should be sent to.

The **second parameter** is the name of the event that is being sent. This is useful for telling the difference between different messages.

The **third parameter** is optional and is the `that` argument to send with the shout. You do not need to specify this parameter if you do not want to.

#### Examples:

1. Send a "custom" message to another remote.
```typescript
const otherRemoteId = "otherRemoteId";

// The other remote will receive a @onRemoteData with 
// that.name === "custom" and that.that === "Hello"
sendRemoteData(otherRemoteId, "custom", "Hello");
```

2. Send a message to all other remotes.
```typescript
const remotes = await os.remotes();
const remoteId = getID(configBot);
const otherRemotes = remotes.filter(id => id !== remoteId);

// All other remotes will receive a @onRemoteData with
// that.name === "custom" and that.that === "Hello"
sendRemoteData(otherRemotes, "custom", "Hello");
```

### `action.reject(action)`


Prevents a previous action from being performed.

This is especially useful when used in a <TagLink tag='@onAnyAction'/> listener since it lets you reject actions before they are performed.

The **first parameter** is the action that should be prevented/rejected.

1. Prevent a toast message from being performed.
```typescript
const toastAction = os.toast("my message");
action.reject(toastAction);
```

## Time Actions

### `os.localTime`

Gets the device-local time as the number of miliseconds since midnight January 1st, 1970 UTC-0 (i.e. the Unix Epoch).
This is what your device's clock thinks the current time is.

#### Examples

```typescript title='Toast the number of miliseconds since the Unix Epoch'
os.toast(os.localTime);
```

### `os.agreedUponTime`

Gets the shared time that has been agreed upon between devices in the inst as the number of miliseconds since midnight January 1st, 1970 UTC-0 (i.e. the Unix Epoch).
This is what your device's clock thinks the inst clock says.

If an agreed upon time cannot be determined (for example, because collaboration is disabled in the inst), then this value will always be `NaN`.

#### Examples

```typescript title='Toast the current shared time'
os.toast(os.agreedUponTime);
```

### `os.instLatency`

Gets the average latency between this device's clock and the inst clock in miliseconds.
Lower values tend to indicate a good connection while higher values tend to indicate a bad connection.

If an agreed upon time cannot be determined (for example, because collaboration is disabled in the inst), then this value will always be `NaN`.

### `os.instTimeOffset`

Gets the calculated time offset between the inst clock and the local clock.
This value is equivalent to `os.agreedUponTime - os.localTime`.

If an agreed upon time cannot be determined (for example, because collaboration is disabled in the inst), then this value will always be `NaN`.

### `os.instTimeOffsetSpread`

Gets the spread between calculated time offsets.
Higher values indicate that `os.agreedUponTime` is less accurate.
Lower values indicate that `os.agreedUponTime` is more accurate.

If an agreed upon time cannot be determined (for example, because collaboration is disabled in the inst), then this value will always be `NaN`.

### `os.deadReckoningTime`

Gets the shared time that has been agreed upon between devices but with an additional 50ms offset added.
This offset attempts to ensure that changes/events will be recieved by all connected devices by the time it occurs, thereby making synchronized actions easier to perform.

If an agreed upon time cannot be determined (for example, because collaboration is disabled in the inst), then this value will always be `NaN`.

## Records Actions


### `os.requestAuthBot()`

Requests that an "authentication" bot be added to the inst for the current browser tab. Auth bots are useful for discovering general information about the logged in user 
and are typically associated with a https://ab1.link user account.
Returns a promise that resolves with a bot that contains information about the signed in user session. Resolves with null if the user was unable to sign in.

On success, the `authBot` global variable will reference the bot that was returned by the promise.

See [Auth Bot Tags](./tags.mdx#auth-bot-tags) for more information.

#### Examples

```typescript title='Request an auth bot for the user'
await os.requestAuthBot();
os.toast("Logged in!");
```

### `os.getPublicRecordKey(name)`

Requests an <GlossaryRef term='record-key'>access key</GlossaryRef> for the <GlossaryRef term='record'>public record</GlossaryRef> with the given name.
Returns a promise that resolves with an object that contains the record key (if successful) or information about the error that occurred.

The **first parameter** is the name of the record to get the key for.

The returned object has the following structure:

```typescript
let result: {
    /**
     * Whether the request was successful.
     */
    success: boolean;

    /**
     * The access key that was created.
     * Not included if the request failed.
     */
    recordKey?: string;

    /**
     * The name of the record that the access key was created for.
     * Not included if the request failed.
     */
    recordName?: string;

    /**
     * The error code for failed requests.
     */
    errorCode?: string;

    /**
     * The error message for failed requests.
     */
    errorMessage?: string;
};
```

#### Examples

```typescript title='Request an access key for a public record.'
const result = await os.getPublicRecordKey('myPublicRecord');

if (result.success) {
    os.toast(result.recordKey);
} else {
    os.toast('Failed ' + result.errorMessage);
}
```

### `os.isRecordKey(value)`

Determines if the given value represents a <GlossaryRef term='record-key'>record key</GlossaryRef>.

Returns true if the value is a record key and false if the value is not a record key.

The **first parameter** is the value to test to see if it is a record key.

#### Examples

```typescript title='Determine if a value is a record key.'
const isRecordKey = os.isRecordKey(tags.myRecordKey);

os.toast(tags.myRecordKey ' is ' + (isRecordKey ? 'a' : 'not a') + ' record key.');
```

### `os.recordData(recordKey, address, data, optionsOrEndpoint?)`

Stores the given <GlossaryRef term='data-record'>data</GlossaryRef> in the given <GlossaryRef term='record'>record</GlossaryRef> at the given address.
If data already exists at the given address, it will be overwritten.

Returns a promise that resolves with an object that indicates if the request was successful.

The **first parameter** is the key that should be used to access the record. You can request a record key by using <ActionLink action='os.getPublicRecordKey(name)' />.

The **second parameter** is the address that the data should be stored at.

The **third parameter** is the data that should be stored. This can be any value that can be serialized to JSON.
Must be less than 300KB in size. If you need to store data larger than 300KB, you can use <ActionLink action='os.recordFile(recordKey, fileData, options?, endpoint?)' /> instead.

The **fourth parameter** is optional and is the options that should be used to record the data. It has the following structure:

```typescript
let options: {
    /**
     * The HTTP Endpoint that should be queried.
     */
    endpoint?: string;

    /**
     * The policy that should be used for updating the record.
     * - true indicates that the value can be updated by anyone.
     * - An array of strings indicates the list of user IDs that are allowed to update the data.
     */
    updatePolicy?: true | string[];

    /**
     * The policy that should be used for deleting the record.
     * - true indicates that the value can be erased by anyone.
     * - An array of strings indicates the list of user IDs that are allowed to delete the data.
     * Note that even if a delete policy is used, the owner of the record can still erase any data in the record.
     */
    deletePolicy?: true | string[];
}
```
Alternatively, it can be the HTTP Endpoint of the records website that the data should be recorded to. If omitted, then the preconfigured records endpoint will be used.
Note that when using a custom endpoint, the record key must be a valid record key for that endpoint.

The returned object has the following structure:

```typescript
let result: {
    /**
     * Whether the request was successful.
     */
    success: boolean;

     */
    errorMessage?: string;
};
```

```

### `os.getData(recordKeyOrName, address, endpoint?)`

Gets the <GlossaryRef term='data-record'>data</GlossaryRef> stored at the given address in the given <GlossaryRef term='record'>record</GlossaryRef>.
Returns a promise that resolves with an object that contains the data (if successful) or information about the error that occurred.

The **first parameter** is the record name or a record key. This indicates the record that the data should be retrieved from.
Note that you don't need a record key in order to retrieve data from a public record. Using a record name will work just fine.

The **second parameter** is the address that the data should be retrieved from.

The **third parameter** is optional and is the HTTP Endpoint of the records website that the data should be recorded to. If omitted, then the preconfigured records endpoint will be used.

Optionally accepts the address before the first item that should be included in the list.
Returns a promise that resolves with an object that contains the items (if successful) or information about the error that occurred.

On ab1.link, the returned list is limited to 25 items.

The **first parameter** is the record name or a record key. This indicates the record that the data should be retrieved from.
Note that you don't need a record key in order to retrieve data from a public record. Using a record name will work just fine.

The **second parameter** is optional and is the address after which items will be included in the list.
Since items are ordered within the record by address, this can be used as way to iterate through all the data items in a record.
If omitted, then the list will start with the first item.

The **third parameter** is optional and is the HTTP Endpoint of the records website that the data should be recorded to. If omitted, then the preconfigured records endpoint will be used.
Note that when using a custom endpoint, the record key must be a valid record key for that endpoint.

The returned object has the following structure:

```typescript
let result: {
    /**
     * Whether the request was successful.
     */
    success: boolean;

    /**
     * The name of the record that the data was stored in.
     * Not included if the request failed.

         * The data contained by the item.
         */
        data: any;
    }[];

    /**
     * The error code for failed requests.
     * Only included if the request failed.
     */
    errorCode?: string;

    /**
     * The error message for failed requests.
     * Only included if the request failed.
     */
    errorMessage?: string;
};
```

#### Examples:

```typescript title='Get a list of data items in a record'
const result = await os.listData('myRecord');

if (result.success) {
    os.toast(result.items);

If data already exists at the given address, it will be overwritten.

Returns a promise that resolves with an object that indicates if the request was successful.

Works the same as <ActionLink action='os.recordData(recordKey, address, data, optionsOrEndpoint?)'/> except that manual approval data records require the user to allow the operation manually.

### `os.eraseManualApprovalData(recordKey, address,  endpoint?)`

Erases the <GlossaryRef term='manual-approval-data-record'>manual approval data</GlossaryRef> stored at the given address in the given <GlossaryRef term='record'>record</GlossaryRef>.
Returns a promise that resolves with an object that contains the data (if successful) or information about the error that occurred.

The file can later be retrieved by using <ActionLink action='os.getFile(urlOrRecordFileResult)' />.

Returns a promise that resolves with an object that contains the URL that the file was stored at (if successful) or information about the error that occurred.

The **first parameter** is the key that should be used to access the record. You can request a record key by using <ActionLink action='os.getPublicRecordKey(name)' />.

The **second parameter** is the data that should be stored in the record. This can be a string, an object, a blob, or an ArrayBuffer.

The **third parameter** is optional and is an object with the following structure:

```typescript
let options: {
    /**
     * The description of the file.
     * Useful for identifying a file.

    description?: string;

    /**
     * The MIME type of the file. This describes the type of data that the file contains. (JSON, HTML, plain text, etc.)
     * See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types for more information.
     * 
     * If this is not specified, the MIME type will be inferred from the data as follows:
     * - If the data is a string, the MIME type will be `text/plain`.

### `os.download(data, filename, mimeType?)`

Downloads the given data with the given filename and [MIME Type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types).

The **first parameter** is the data that should be downloaded. This
can be a string, object, or binary data in the form of an [ArrayBuffer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/ArrayBuffer)
or [Blob](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/Web/API/Blob).

The **second parameter** is the name of the file that should be downloaded.

The **third parameter** is optional and is the [MIME Type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types) that the downloaded file should have.
If not provided, then it will be inferred from the provided filename.

#### Examples:

1. Download a text file named "test.txt" that contains "abc".
```typescript
os.download("abc", "test.txt");
```

### `os.downloadBots(bots, filename)`


Downloads the given array of bots as a `.aux` or a `.pdf` file with the given filename.
Useful for quickly backing up a set of bots.

The **first parameter** is the array of bots that should be downloaded.

The **second parameter** is the name of the file that the bots should be stored in.
If the filename ends with `.pdf`, then a PDF file will be downloaded with the bots as embedded data.
Otherwise, `.aux` will automatically be added to the end of the filename.

#### Examples:

1. Download all the bots in the "abc" dimension as "abcBots.aux".
```typescript
os.downloadBots(getBots(inDimension("abc")), "abcBots");
```

2. Download the current bot as "currentBot.aux".
```typescript
os.downloadBots([bot], "currentBot");
```

3. Download all bots as "myServer.pdf".
```typescript
os.downloadBots(getBots(), "myServer.pdf");
```

### `os.downloadInst()`


Downloads all of the shared bots into a `.aux` file on the player's computer.
The file will have the same name as the inst.

Note that this function is almost exactly the same as <ActionLink action='os.downloadBots(bots, filename)'/>.
The only difference is that all bots in the shared space are included and the file is named for you automatically.

#### Examples:

1. Download the entire inst.
```typescript
os.downloadInst();
```

### `os.run(script)`


Runs the given script.
The script will be executed in a separate environment with no `bot`, `tags`, `this`, `data`, and `that` variables.
This means that you need to use the <ActionLink action='getBot(...filters)'/> or <ActionLink action='getBots(...filters)'/> functions to read bot data.

Returns a promise that resolves with the returned script value after it has been executed.

The **first parameter** is the script that should be executed.

#### Examples:

1. Run a script that says "hello".
```typescript
os.run("os.toast('hello');");
```

2. Run a script from the `#script` tag on the current bot.
```typescript
os.run(tags.script);
```

3. Run a script and toast the result.
```typescript
const result = await os.run("return 594 + 391");
os.toast(result);
```

### `os.replaceDragBot(botOrMod)`

Replaces the bot that the user is dragging with the given bot or mod.

If called when the user is not dragging anything, then the given bot or mod will be dragged using the current input method.
When in VR, the current input method is the most recently used VR controller. Otherwise it is the mouse/touchscreen.

The **first parameter** is the bot or mod that should be dragged. 
If given a bot while dragging, then that bot's <TagLink tag='@onDrag'/> will be skippped but <TagLink tag='@onDrop'/> will be called.
If given a bot when not dragging, then that bot's <TagLink tag='@onDrag'/> and <TagLink tag='@onDrop'/> will be called.

#### Examples:

1. Drag a clone of this bot.
```typescript
let clone = create(this);
os.replaceDragBot(clone);
```

2. Drag a mod that makes other bots red.
```typescript
os.replaceDragBot({
    "color": "red"
});
```

### `os.enableCustomDragging()`

Enables "custom dragging" for the current bot drag operation.

Custom dragging tells CasualOS to not move the bot to the dragged position.
Instead, it will calculate where the bot would be dragged and send that information in the <TagLink tag='@onDragging'/> and <TagLink tag='@onAnyBotDragging'/> listeners.

This is useful for custom bot dragging behavior like choosing to scale or rotate a bot instead of moving it.

#### Examples:

```typescript title='Enable custom dragging for the current drag operation'
os.enableCustomDragging();
```

### `os.addDropSnap(...targets)`

Specifies a list of snap targets that can be used to position the currently dragged bot.

If called when the user is not dragging anything, then this function does nothing.

**Each parameter** is a snap target and can be one of the following values:

<PossibleValuesTable>
  <PossibleValueCode value='ground'>
    The bot will snap to the ground plane. (Default when not in VR)
  </PossibleValueCode>
  <PossibleValueCode value='grid'>
    The bot will snap to individual grid tiles.
  </PossibleValueCode>
  <PossibleValueCode value='face'>
    The bot will snap the faces of other pointable bots.
  </PossibleValueCode>
  <PossibleValueCode value='bots'>
    The bot will snap to other pointable bots.
  </PossibleValueCode>
  <PossibleValue value='A snap point object'>
    The bot will snap to the specified position when dragged within the specified distance.
  </PossibleValue>
  <PossibleValue value='A snap axis object'>
    The bot will snap to the specified axis when dragged within the specified distance.
    Currently not supported on the map portal.
  </PossibleValue>
</PossibleValuesTable>

Snap point objects should have the following form:
```typescript
let snapPoint: {
    /**
     * The position that the bot should be snapped to.
     */
    position: { x: number, y: number, z: number };

    /**
     * The distance that the bot should be from the position in order to snap to it.
     */
    distance: number;
};
```

Snap axis objects should have the following form:
```typescript
let snapAxis: {
    /**
     * The direction that the axis travels along.
     */
    direction: { x: number, y: number, z: number };

    /**
     * The center point that the axis travels through.
     */
    origin: { x: number, y: number, z: number };

    /**
     * The distance that the bot should be from any 
     * point along the axis in order to snap to it.
     */
    distance: number;
};
```

#### Examples:

        y: 0,
        z: 3,
    },
    distance: 1
});
```

4. Snap the dragged bot to the global X axis.
```typescript
os.addDropSnap({
    direction: {
        x: 1,
        y: 0,
        z: 0,
    },
    origin: {
        x: 0,
        y: 0,
        z: 0
    },
    distance: 2
});
```

5. Snap the dragged bot to the center or bot faces.
```typescript
os.addDropSnap({
    position: {
        x: 0,
        y: 0,
        z: 0,
    },
    distance: 1
}, "face");
```

### `os.addBotDropSnap(bot, ...targets)`

Specifies a list of snap targets that can be used to position the currently dragged bot when it is being dropped on the given bot.
This function is useful for making some bots act like a "selector" or mask for drop areas.

If called when the user is not dragging anything, then this function does nothing.

The **first parameter** is the bot which, when the dragged bot is being dropped onto it (as indicated by <TagLink tag='@onDropEnter'/>/<TagLink tag='@onDropExit'/>),
the specified snap targets will take effect.

  <PossibleValueCode value='ground'>
    The bot will snap to the ground plane. (Default when not in VR)
  </PossibleValueCode>
  <PossibleValueCode value='grid'>
    The bot will snap to individual grid tiles.
  </PossibleValueCode>
  <PossibleValueCode value='face'>
    The bot will snap the faces of other pointable bots.
  </PossibleValueCode>
  <PossibleValueCode value='bots'>
    The bot will snap to other pointable bots.
  </PossibleValueCode>
  <PossibleValue value='A snap point object'>
    The bot will snap to the specified position when dragged within the specified distance.
  </PossibleValue>
</PossibleValuesTable>

Snap point objects should have the following form:
```typescript
let snapPoint: {
    /**
     * The position that the bot should be snapped to.
     */
    position: { x: number, y: number, z: number };

    /**
     * The distance that the bot should be from the position in order to snap to it.
     */
    distance: number;
};
```

    position: {
        x: 0,
        y: 0,
        z: 0,
    },
    distance: 1
}, "face");
```

### `os.addDropGrid(...targets)`

Specifies a list of grids that can be used to position the currently dragged bot.

If called when the user is not dragging anything, then this function does nothing.

**Each parameter** is an object with the following properties:

```typescript
let grid: {
    /**
     * The 3D position that the grid should appear at.
     */
    position?: { x: number, y: number, z: number };

    /**
     * The 3D rotation that the grid should appear at.
     */
    rotation?: { x: number, y: number, z: number, w?: number };

    /**
     * The bot that defines the portal that the grid should exist in.
     * 
     * If null, then this defaults to the bot that is showing the portal that the dragged bot exists in.
     * For common cases this will be the configBot, but it could also be a bot that has a portal form.
     */
    portalBot?: Bot | string;

    /**
     * The tag that the portal uses to determine which dimension to show.
     * Defaults to formAddress if the specified portalBot is not the configBot and gridPortal if the specified portalBot is the configBot.
     */
    portalTag?: string;

### `os.addBotDropGrid(bot, ...targets)`

Specifies a list of grids that can be used to position the currently dragged bot when it is being dropped on the given bot.

If called when the user is not dragging anything, then this function does nothing.

```typescript
let grid: {
    /**
     * The 3D position that the grid should appear at.
     */
    position?: { x: number, y: number, z: number };

    /**
     * The 3D rotation that the grid should appear at.
     */

    /**
     * The bot that defines the portal that the grid should exist in.
     * 
     * If null, then this defaults to the bot that is showing the portal that the dragged bot exists in.
     * For common cases this will be the configBot, but it could also be a bot that has a portal form.
     */
    portalBot?: Bot | string;

    /**
     * The tag that the portal uses to determine which dimension to show.
     * Defaults to formAddress if the specified portalBot is not the configBot and gridPortal if the specified portalBot is the configBot.

            "id": "079847e4-6a58-423d-9a86-8d4ef8be5970",
            "tags": {
                "color": "red"
            }
        }
    }
}`);
```

### `os.parseBotsFromData(data)`

Parses a list of bot mods from the given string of data.
The data can be JSON or the contents of a PDF file.
Returns an array of mods where each mod has the structure of a bot (i.e. it has `id` and `tags` properties).
Returns null if the data is not valid JSON or PDF.

The **first parameter** is the string of JSON data or the contents of the PDF file that should parsed.

```typescript title='Parse the list of bots in an @onFileUpload'
let bots = os.parseBotsFromData(that.file.data);
```

### `os.version()`


Gets information about the version of CasualOS.

The returned value is an object with the following properties:

```typescript
const returned: {
    /**
     * The commit of the hash that AUX was built from.
     */
    hash: string;

    /**
     * The full version number.
     */
    version: string;

    /**
     * The major portion of the version.
     */
    major: number;

    /**
     * The minor portion of the version.
     */
    minor: number;

    /**
     * The patch portion of the version.
     */
    patch: number;

    /**
     * Whether this version is an alpha (i.e. test) version.
     */
    alpha: boolean | number;

    /**
     * Gets the player mode of this CasualOS version.
     * 
     * - "player" indicates that the instance has been configured for experiencing AUXes.
     * - "builder" indicates that the instance has been configured for building AUXes.
     */
    playerMode: 'player' | 'builder';
};
```

#### Examples:

1. Get the current version and popup a message with it.
```typescript
const info = os.version();
os.toast(info.version);
```

2. Check whether the current inst is for playing AUXes.
```typescript
const info = os.version();
const isPlayer = info.playerMode === "player";
os.toast('Is Player: ' + isPlayer);
```

### `os.device()`

Gets information about the device that the player is using.

The returned value is an object with the following properties:

```typescript
const returned: {
    supportsAR: boolean;
    supportsVR: boolean;
    isCollaborative: boolean;
};
```

#### Examples:

1. Get the device info and popup a message with it.
```typescript
const info = os.device();
os.toast(info);
```

### `os.isCollaborative()`

Gets whether the current session was loaded with collaborative features enabled.

When true, CasualOS will attempt to sync the shared (including `tempShared` and `remoteTempShared`) spaces with other players.
When false, CasualOS will treat all the shared spaces like they are all `tempLocal`.

#### Examples:

1. Toast whether the current session is collaborative.
```typescript
const isCollaborative = os.isCollaborative();

os.toast(isCollaborative ? "We are collaborative!" : "We are not collaborative!");
```

### `os.requestFullscreenMode()`

Attempts to enter fullscreen mode. Depending on which web browser the player is using, this might ask for permission to go fullscreen.

Note that iPhones currently don't support fullscreen mode.

#### Examples:

1. Enter fullscreen mode.
```typescript
os.requestFullscreenMode();
```

### `os.exitFullscreenMode()`

Exists fullscreen mode.

#### Examples:

1. Exit fullscreen mode.
```typescript
os.exitFullscreenMode();
```

### `os.setupInst(inst, botOrMod?)`

Sends an action to the server that will create the given inst if it does not exist and places a clone of the given bot or mod in it.
The new bot will only be added to the inst if the inst did not exist.
The action is only executed if <TagLink tag='@onAnyAction'/> has been configured to perform events in `device` actions.

Returns a promise that resolves when the inst has been setup.

The **first parameter** is the ID of the inst that should be setup.

The **second parameter** is optional and is the bot or mod that should be cloned into the new inst. After the bot is created, <TagLink tag='@onCreate'/> will be triggered.

#### Examples:

Before `os.setupInst()` will work, you need to setup the <TagLink tag='@onAnyAction'/> tag to execute events from remote devices.
This is because when you run `os.setupInst()` from a PC or phone (a.k.a. A "remote device"), it needs to send an event to the server to actually create the new inst.
By default, AUX does not perform actions that are received from a remote device. You must instruct AUX to execute these yourself.

Ensure that <TagLink tag='@onAnyAction'/> is setup properly.
The following script will execute `setup_server` events that were sent from other devices:
```typescript
// Device actions are actions that were sent to this computer from another device
if (that.action.type === 'device') {

    // The setup_server action is the action that is created
    // from os.setupInst()
    if (that.action.event.type === 'setup_server') {

        // Execute the setup_server action
        action.perform(that.action.event);
    }
}
```

1. Create the "test" inst:
```typescript
await os.setupInst("test");
```

2. Create the "test" inst with a bot inside it:
```typescript
await os.setupInst("test", {
    "name": "bob",
    "color": "red"
});
```

3. Create the "test" inst with a bot that places a bot in the "abc" dimension:
```typescript
await os.setupInst("test", {
    "onCreate": `@
        create({
            creator: null,
            label: "This is in the dimension!",
            color: "blue",
            abc: true
        });

        destroy(this);
    `
});
```

### `os.remoteCount(inst?)`

Gets the number of remotes that are viewing the current inst.
Optionally takes a parameter which is the inst that the number of remotes should be retrieved for. If omitted, then the current inst will be checked.
Returns a promise that resolves with the number of active remotes.

The **first parameter** is optional and is the name of the inst that the number of remotes should be retrieved for.
If not specified, then the current inst <ActionLink action="os.getCurrentInst()">current inst</ActionLink> will be used.

#### Examples

1. Get the number of remotes in the current inst.
```typescript
const numberOfRemotes = await os.remoteCount();

os.toast("Number of Remotes: " + numberOfRemotes);
```

2. Get the number of remotes in the `test` inst.
```typescript
const numberOfRemotes = await os.remoteCount('test');

os.toast("Number of Remotes: " + numberOfRemotes);
```

### `os.totalRemoteCount()`

Gets the number of devices that are connected to the server.
Returns a promise that resolves with the number of active devices.

#### Examples

1. Get the number of devices on the server.
```typescript
const numberOfDevices = await os.totalRemoteCount();

os.toast("Number of Devices: " + numberOfDevices);
```

### `os.instances()`

Gets the list of instances that are stored on the server.
Returns a promise that resolves with the list of inst names.

#### Examples

1. Get the list of instances on the server.
```typescript
const instances = await os.instances();

os.toast("Instances " + instances.join(','));
```

### `os.instStatuses()`

Gets the list of instances that are stored on the server along with the last time that they were updated.
Returns a promise that resolves with the list of instances.

The resolved list is sorted by the most recently updated first and the least recently updated last.

#### Examples

1. Get the list of instances on the server along with their status.
```typescript
const instances = await os.instStatuses();

os.toast("Instances " + getJSON(instances));
```

### `os.remotes()`

Gets the list of remote IDs that are connected to the current inst.
Returns a promise that resolves with the list of remote IDs.

The resolved list will always have at least one value that represents the current remote.

#### Examples

1. Get the list of remote IDs.
```typescript
const remotes = await os.remotes();

os.toast("Remotes " + remotes.join(','));
```

### `os.beginAudioRecording(options?)`

Starts a new audio recording. Returns a promise that resolves when recording has started.
The returned promise will throw an error if recording could not be started. Reasons for this include insufficient permissions and not having a microphone.

The **first parameter** is optional and is an object that determines how the audio should be recorded. It has the following structure:

```typescript
let options: {
    /**
     * Whether to stream the audio recording.
     * If streaming is enabled, then @onAudioChunk will be triggered whenever a new 
     * piece of audio is available.
     */
    stream?: boolean;

     /**
      * The MIME type that should be produced. If the given MIME type is not supported, then the default will be used.
      * Defaults to a containerized format (audio/mp3, audio/webm, etc.) if not specified.
      */
    mimeType?: string;
 
     /**
      * The number of samples per second (Hz) that audio/x-raw recordings should use.
      * Defaults to 44100 if not specified.
      */
    sampleRate?: number;
};
```

Triggers <TagLink tag='@onBeginAudioRecording'/> once recording has started and continuously triggers <TagLink tag='@onAudioChunk'/> if `stream` is set to `true`.

#### Examples:

1. Record some audio for 10 seconds and download the file.
```typescript
await os.beginAudioRecording();
await os.sleep(10000);
const data = await os.endAudioRecording();

os.download(data);
```

2. Stream some raw audio data for 10 seconds.
```typescript
await os.beginAudioRecording({
    stream: true,
    mimeType: 'audio/x-raw'
});
// @onAudioChunk will be called whenever a new sample is available.
await os.sleep(10000);
await os.endAudioRecording();
```

### `os.endAudioRecording()`

Stops the audio recording that is in progress.
Returns a promise that resolves with the recorded data.
If the recording was started with `stream: true`, then the recorded data will be null.

Triggers <TagLink tag='@onEndAudioRecording'/> once recording has finished.

#### Examples:

1. Record some audio for 10 seconds and download the file.
```typescript
await os.beginAudioRecording();
await os.sleep(10000);
const data = await os.endAudioRecording();

os.download(data);
```

### `os.meetCommand(command, ...args)`

Send a command to the Jitsi Meet API. The commands are only valid if the meet portal is fully loaded (see <TagLink tag='@onMeetLoaded'/>).

A full list of commands can be be found here in the [Jitsi Meet Handbook](https://jitsi.github.io/handbook/docs/dev-guide/dev-guide-iframe#commands)

#### Examples:

1. Change user's meet display name
```typescript
os.meetCommand('displayName', 'ABC123');
```
2. Close the meet.
```typescript
os.meetCommand('hangup')
```

### `os.meetFunction(functionName, ...args)`

Executes the given function on the Jitsi Meet API and returns a promise that resolves with the result.
The functions are only valid if the meet portal is fully loaded (see <TagLink tag='@onMeetLoaded'/>).

A full list of functions can be found here in the [Jitsi Meet Handbook](https://jitsi.github.io/handbook/docs/dev-guide/dev-guide-iframe/#functions).

#### Examples:

```typescript title='Get a list of all the participants.'
const participants = await os.meetFunction('getParticipantsInfo')
```

```typescript title='Get a list of available breakout rooms.'
const rooms = await os.meetFunction('listBreakoutRooms');
```

## Debug Actions


### `os.createDebugger(options?)`

Creates a debug environment that can be used to simulate bots in isolation from the rest of the inst.
Returns an object that contains all of the action functions.

One of the special things about debug environments is that the bots in the environment are totally isolated from regular bots.
This means that functions like <ActionLink action='getBots(..filters)'/> can only access bots that have been created in the debugger
and actions like <ActionLink action='os.toast(message, duration?)'/> don't do anything automatically.
This can be useful for automated testing where you want to see what some bots will do without actually letting them do anything.

The returned object can be used to create/find bots in the debug environment and simulate interactions.
The debug environment also contains several functions that make it easy to observe what has happened inside the environment and therefore determine if everything was performed correctly.

The **first parameter** is optional and is the options that should be used to configure the debugger. It is an object and should have the following structure:
```typescript
let options: {
    /**
     * Whether to use real UUIDs for Bot IDs and the uuid() function.
     * If set to false, then UUIDs will be predictable starting with "uuid-1" and continuing up ("uuid-2", "uuid-3", etc.).
     * If set to true, then UUIDs will be unpredictable and unique.
     * Defaults to false.
     */
    useRealUUIDs?: boolean;

    /**
     * Whether to allow scripts to be asynchronous.
     * If false, then all scripts will be forced to be synchronous.
     * Defaults to false.
     * Synchronous scripts are easier to test because they don't rely on back-and-forth (two-way) communication to handle things like web.hook().
     */
     allowAsynchronousScripts: boolean;

     /**
     * The data that the configBot should be created from.
     * Can be a mod or another bot.
     */
    configBot: Bot | BotTags;
};
```

#### Examples:

```typescript title='Create a debugger and copy this bot into it.'
// Note: variables cannot be named "debugger" so we use the name "debug" instead.
const debug = os.createDebugger();
const debuggerBot = debug.create(thisBot);
```

```typescript title='Test a script in the debugger'
const debug = os.createDebugger();
const debuggerBot = debug.create({
    test: '@tags.hit = true;'
});
debug.shout('test');

if (debuggerBot.tags.hit) {
    os.toast('Success!');
} else {
    os.toast('Failed!');
}
```

```typescript title='Find out what actions a script performs'
const debug = os.createDebugger();
const debuggerBot = debug.create({
    test: '@os.toast("hello!")'
});
debug.shout('test');

const actions = debug.getCommonActions();
os.toast(actions);
```

```typescript title='Create a debugger with a custom configBot'
const debug = os.createDebugger({
    configBot: {
        test: '@console.log("Hello, World!");'
    }
});
debug.shout('test');
```

```typescript title='Mask the web.get() function.'
const debug = os.createDebugger();
let url = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/The_star_formation_region_Messier_17.jpg/1200px-The_star_formation_region_Messier_17.jpg";
const debuggerBot = debug.create({
    url,
    test: '@return await web.get(tags.url)'
});

debug.web.get.mask(url)
    .returns({
        data: 'test data',
        status: 200
    });

const [result] = debug.shout('test');

assertEqual(result, {
    data: 'test data',
    status: 200
});
os.toast("Success!");
```

### `os.getExecutingDebugger()`

Gets the debugger that is currently executing the script.
Returns null if the script is not running in a debugger.

#### Examples:

```typescript title='Get the debugger that this script is running in'
const debug = os.getExecutingDebugger();
console.log(debug);
```

Debug actions are actions that are either useful for automated testing/debugging or only available when run inside a debugger.

### `assert(condition, message?)`

Verifies that the given condition is true. If it is not, then an error is thrown with the given message.
This function is useful for automated testing since tests should ideally throw an error if the test fails.
It can also be useful to make sure that some important code is only run if a precondition is met.

The **first paramater** is the condition that should be verified.

The **second parameter** is optional and is the message that should be included in the error.

#### Examples

```typescript title='Assert that the tag color is "blue"'
assert(tags.color === "blue", "The tag color is not blue!");
```

### `assertEqual(received, expected)`

Verifies that the given values are equal to each other. If they are not, then an error is thrown.
This function is useful for automated testing since tests should ideally throw an error if the test fails.
It can also be useful to make sure that some important code is only run if a precondition is met.

#### Examples

```typescript title='Assert that the tag color is "blue"'
assertEqual(tags.color, "blue");
```

```typescript title='Assert that the bot contains some specific tag values'
assertEqual(tags, {
    color: "blue",
    home: true,
    homeX: 0,
    homeY: 0
});
```

### `getAllActions()`

Gets the list of action objects that have been performed by bots in the current debugger.
Action objects are used by CasualOS to represent changes to bots or external effects that should be performed.
Examples of this are <ActionLink action='create(...mods)'/>, <ActionLink action='os.toast(message, duration?)'/> and <ActionLink action='os.enableVR()'/>.

This function is useful for automated testing because you can use it to validate the actions that a script has performed.

Only available inside a debugger that was created using <ActionLink action='os.createDebugger(options?)'/>.

#### Examples:

```typescript title='Get the list of bot changes and actions that have been performed in a debugger'
const debug = os.createDebugger();
debug.create({
    test: '@os.toast("Hello")'
});
debug.shout("test");

const actions = debug.getAllActions();

assertEqual(actions, [
    {
        type: 'add_bot',
        id: 'uuid-1',
        bot: {
            id: 'uuid-1',
            tags: {
                test: '@os.toast("Hello")'
            }
        }
    },
    {
        type: 'show_toast',
        message: 'Hello',
        duration: 2000
    }
]);
```

### `getCommonActions()`

Gets the list of common action objects that have been performed by bots in the current debugger.
Action objects are used by CasualOS to represent changes to bots or external effects that should be performed.
Common actions are actions that do not immediately change bots or bot tags or masks.

Examples of common actions are <ActionLink action='os.toast(message, duration?)'/> and <ActionLink action='os.enableVR()'/>.

Only available inside a debugger that was created using <ActionLink action='os.createDebugger(options?)'/>.

#### Examples:

```typescript title='Get the list of actions that have been performed in a debugger'
const debug = os.createDebugger();
debug.create({
    test: '@os.toast("Hello")'
});
debug.shout("test");

const actions = debug.getCommonActions();

assertEqual(actions, [
    {
        type: 'show_toast',
        message: 'Hello',
        duration: 2000
    }
]);
```

### `getBotActions()`

Gets the list of bot actions that have been performed by bots in the current debugger.
Action objects are used by CasualOS to represent changes to bots or external effects that should be performed.
Bot actions are actions that immediately change bots or bot tags or masks.

Examples of bot actions are <ActionLink action='create(...mods)'/>, <ActionLink action='destroy(bot)'/> or <ActionLink action='setTagMask(bot, tag, value, space?)'/>.

Only available inside a debugger that was created using <ActionLink action='os.createDebugger(options?)'/>.

#### Examples:

```typescript title='Get the list of bot changes that have been performed in a debugger'
const debug = os.createDebugger();
debug.create({
    test: '@os.toast("Hello")'
});
debug.shout("test");

const actions = debug.getBotActions();

assertEqual(actions, [
    {
        type: 'add_bot',
        id: 'uuid-1',
        bot: {
            id: 'uuid-1',
            tags: {
                test: '@os.toast("Hello")'
            }
        }
    },
]);
```

### `getErrors()`

Gets the list of errors that have occurred in the current debugger.
Errors occur when an exceptional event happens in a script and prevents the rest of the script from executing.

Debuggers capture these errors and let you inspect them afterwards.
Only available inside a debugger that was created using <ActionLink action='os.createDebugger(options?)'/>.

#### Examples:

```typescript title='Get the list of errors that have happened in a debugger'
const debug = os.createDebugger();
debug.create({
    test: '@throw new Error("My Error")'
});
debug.shout("test");

const errors = debug.getErrors();

assertEqual(errors.length, 1);
assertEqual(errors[0].error, new Error("My Error"));
assertEqual(errors[0].tag, "test");
```

## Math Actions

### `math.sum(list)`


Calculates the numerical sum of the given values.

```typescript
const ageDeviation = math.stdDev(getBotTagValues('#age'));
```

### `math.getSeededRandomNumberGenerator(seed?)`

Creates a new random number generator from the given seed and returns it.
Because of how random number generators work, generators created with the same seed will return the same sequence of random numbers.

The **first parameter** is optional and is the number or string that should be used as the [seed value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_seed) for the random number generator.
If omitted, then a seed will be chosen in a somewhat unpredictable manner.

Returns an object with the following properties:

```typescript
let result: {
    /**
     * The seed that was used to create this random number generator.
     */
    seed: number | string;

    /**
     * Generates a random real number between the given minimum and maximum values.
     */
    random(min?: number, max?: number): number;

    /**
     * Generates a random integer between the given minimum and maximum values.
     */
    randomInt(min: number, max: number): number;
};
```

#### Examples:

```typescript title='Create two random number generators with the same seed.'
let random1 = math.getSeededRandomNumberGenerator(123);
let random2 = math.getSeededRandomNumberGenerator(123);

os.toast(random1.randomInt(0, 10) + ' == ' + random2.randomInt(0, 10) + ' == 9');
```

```typescript title='Create a random number generator and store it for later'
let randomNumberGenerator = math.getSeededRandomNumberGenerator(123);

// Store it in the bot variables so it can be used in other scripts.
bot.vars.randomNumberGenerator = randomNumberGenerator;
```

### `math.setRandomSeed(seed)`

Sets the seed that should be used for the random numbers generated with <ActionLink action='math.randomInt(min, max)'/> and <ActionLink action='math.random(min, max)'/>.

The **first parameter** is the number or string that should be used as the [seed value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_seed) for the internal random number generator.
If null is provided, then a seed will be chosen in a somewhat unpredictable manner.

#### Examples:

```typescript title='Set the random seed for math.random() and math.randomInt().'
math.setRandomSeed(123);

expect(math.randomInt(0, 10)).toBe(9);
expect(math.random()).toBe(0.36078753814001446);
```

```typescript title='Clear the random seed.'
math.setRandomSeed(null);
```

### `math.randomInt(min, max)`


Generates a random integer number between the given minimum and maximum values.

The **first parameter** is the smallest allowed value that can be generated.

The **second parameter** is the largest allowed value that can be generated.

#### Examples:

1. Generate a random number between `5` and `10`.
```typescript
const number = math.randomInt(5, 10);
```

### `math.random(min, max)`

Generates a random number between the given minimum and maximum values.

The **first parameter** is the smallest allowed value that can be generated.

The **second parameter** is the largest allowed value that can be generated.

```typescript
const number = math.random(0, Math.PI);
```

### `math.getForwardDirection(rotation)`

Gets the forward direction for the given rotation.

Useful for finding where a bot would be pointing if it has a custom rotation.

The **first parameter** is an object containing the `x`, `y`, and `z` of the rotation in radians.

#### Examples:

1. Get the direction that a pointer is pointing.
```typescript
const pointerRotation = os.getPointerRotation('mouse');
const pointerDirection = math.getForwardDirection(pointerRotation);
os.toast(pointerDirection);
```

### `math.intersectPlane(origin, direction)`

os.toast(groundPoint);
```

### `math.getAnchorPointOffset(anchorPoint)`

    5
);

os.toast(result); // { x: 25, y: 30, z: 35 }
```

### `math.areClose(first, second)`

Determines if the given numbers are within 2 decimal places of each other.

Because [JavaScript numbers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number) have limited precision, some calculations cannot be represented
like they can in normal math. For example, `1/3` is `0.3333...` but in JavaScript `1/3` gives `0.33333333333333331483`.
This inaccuracy can cause problems when many calculations are done, which can cause numbers that appear to be the same to actually be different.

The solution is to check the difference between two numbers to see if it is below some arbitrary threshold. In this case, the threshold is `0.005`.

The **first parameter** is the first number that should be checked.

The **second parameter** is the second number that should be checked.

#### Examples:

1. Determine `0.1 + 0.2` is close to `0.3`.
```typescript
const first = 0.1 + 0.2;
const second = 0.3;
const result = math.areClose(first, second);
const areEqual = first === second;
os.toast("Equal: " + areEqual + ", Close: " + result); // Equal: false, Close: true
```

    y: 5,
    z: 6
});
```

let mod = mod.cameraRotationOffset({
    x: 4,
    y: 5,
    z: 6
});

### `crypto.encrypt(secret, data)`

[Encrypts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption) the given data using the given secret key (also commonly known as a password) and returns the result.

Use the <ActionLink action='crypto.decrypt(key, data)'/> function to decrypt the data.

_Always use a strong and unique secret key._ Use a password manager such as LastPass or 1Password to help you create and keep track of them.

Assuming a strong secret, this method will return a string of encrypted data that is _confidential_ (unreadable without the key),
_reliable_ (the encrypted data cannot be changed without making it unreadable), and _authentic_ (decryptability proves that this specific key was used to encrypt the data).

As a consequence, encrypting the same data with the same key will produce different results.
This is to ensure that an attacker cannot correlate different pieces of data to potentially deduce the original plaintext.

Encrypts the given data using an authenticated encryption mechanism 
based on [XSalsa20](https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/advanced/stream_ciphers/xsalsa20) (An encryption cipher) and [Poly1305](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poly1305) (A message authentication code).
Additionally uses [scrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt) for [password-based key derivation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_derivation_function). 

The **first parameter** is the secret that should be used to encrypt the data. Use a strong an unique secret for maximum security.

The **second parameter** is the string data that should be encrypted.

#### Examples

1. Encrypt the given data and toast it.
```typescript
const encrypted = crypto.encrypt("key", "hello, world");
os.toast(encrypted);
```

### `crypto.decrypt(secret, data)`

[Decrypts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption) the given data using the given secret key (also commonly known as a password) and returns the result.

Use the <ActionLink action='crypto.encrypt(key, data)'/> function to encrypt the data.

The **first parameter** is the secret that should be used to decrypt the data. This should be the same key that was used to encrypt the data.

The **second parameter** is the data from <ActionLink action='crypto.encrypt(key, data)'/> that should be decrypted.

#### Examples

1. Decrypt the given data and toast it.
```typescript
const decrypted = crypto.decrypt("key", "v1.vWUhsdfiKkxXi9Rt+BBNbcP/TiHZpxUL.iikPvWN6rNncY3j045gM0268MoRi0NNf.IpWYgzXQmjRea4MNLDXB1GmrinWLSSOMw+NfqeE=");
os.toast(decrypted);
```

### `crypto.isEncrypted(cyphertext)`

Determines if the given value has been encrypted using <ActionLink action='crypto.encrypt(secret, data)'/>.
Returns `true` if the data is encrypted and `false` otherwise.

The **first parameter** is the value that should be tested to see if it has been encrypted.

#### Examples

1. Determine if a value is encrypted.
```typescript
const encrypted = crypto.isEncrypted("hello, world");
os.toast('Is it encrypted? ' + encrypted);
```

### `crypto.keypair(secret)`

Creates a keypair that can be used to [digitially sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature) and verify data.

Use <ActionLink action='crypto.sign(keypair, secret, data)'/> and <ActionLink action='crypto.verify(keypair, signature, data)'/> to sign and verify the data.

Keypairs are made up of a private key and a public key.
The private key is a special value that can be used to create digital signatures and
the public key is a related value that can be used to verify that a digitital signature was created by the private key.

The private key is called "private" because it is encrypted using the given secret
while the public key is called "public" because it is not encrypted so anyone can use it if they have access to it.

Note that both the private and public keys are randomly generated, so while the public is unencrypted, it won't be able to be used by someone else unless
they have access to it.

The **first parameter** is the secret that should be used to encrypt the private key of the keypair.

#### Examples:

1. Create a keypair and toast it.
```typescript
const keypair = crypto.keypair("my secret");
os.toast(keypair);
```

### `crypt.sign(keypair, secret, data)`

Calculates the digital signature for the given data using the given keypair and secret (also commonly known as a password).

Use <ActionLink action='crypto.keypair(secret)'/> to create a keypair that can be used to create signatures.

Use <ActionLink action='crypto.verify(keypair, signature, data)'/> to validate signatures.

Digital signatures are used to verifying the authenticity and integrity of data.

This works by leveraging asymmetric encryption but in reverse.

If we can encrypt some data such that only the public key of a keypair can decrypt it, then we can prove that
the data was encrypted (i.e. signed) by the corresponding private key.

And since the public key is available to everyone but the private
key is only usable when you have the secret, we can use this to prove that a particular piece of data was signed by whoever knows the secret.

Note that because of how digital signatures work, signing the same data with the same keypair will produce the same signature.

The **first parameter** is the keypair that should be used to sign the data.

The **second parameter** is the secret that was used to encrypt the private key of the keypair.

The **third parameter** is the string data that should be signed.

#### Examples:

1. Create a signature for the string `"hello"`.
```typescript
// Returned from crypto.keypair()
const keypair = "vK1.ugqz8HzhaQhfORc8Coc6WVHTciMrcmfSUuw99KLRJYk=.djEuak1QNkF5MHFzMTBFMXRHamR1ZFhqTmRTV3AycjVyZUsudzFjSWZWVUFQVUdqK3hTM000NUduYUlNQ094SUhCTUEuanYrZEQwNVJFVGo3UzRPSklQQUkxc3U0anZjUmxrTEM2OW1BajkyMkxxdTFZd2sxNzV5QW9Dc3gwU3RENlQ0cmtNTVk4b2Zna2JRVTIrQmp5OUIrTTJsaFI2ajcyb0lJdmdSWkRXRU9lZE09";

const signature = crypto.sign(keypair, "my secret", "hello");
os.toast(signature);
```

### `crypto.verify(keypair, signature, data)`

Use <ActionLink action='crypto.sign(keypair, secret, data)'/> to create signatures.

The **first parameter** is the keypair that was used to create the signature.

The **second parameter** is the signature that was returned from <ActionLink action='crypto.sign(keypair, secret, data)'/>.

The **third parameter** is the data that was used in the call to <ActionLink action='crypto.sign(keypair, secret, data)'/>.

#### Examples:

1. Validate a signature.
```typescript
// Returned from crypto.keypair()
const keypair = "vK1.ugqz8HzhaQhfORc8Coc6WVHTciMrcmfSUuw99KLRJYk=.djEuak1QNkF5MHFzMTBFMXRHamR1ZFhqTmRTV3AycjVyZUsudzFjSWZWVUFQVUdqK3hTM000NUduYUlNQ094SUhCTUEuanYrZEQwNVJFVGo3UzRPSklQQUkxc3U0anZjUmxrTEM2OW1BajkyMkxxdTFZd2sxNzV5QW9Dc3gwU3RENlQ0cmtNTVk4b2Zna2JRVTIrQmp5OUIrTTJsaFI2ajcyb0lJdmdSWkRXRU9lZE09";

// Returned from crypto.sign()
const signature = "vS1.uF93ErJBhdI/vqRF2XD2zgRAO96vKc9mx8crn6Kasijmx92px36B/alLGluU22tgCav/nNQEHdV2zZoHPgy7Dg==";

const valid = crypto.verify(keypair, signature, "hello");
os.toast(valid);
```

### `crypto.asymmetric.keypair(secret)`

Creates a keypair that can be used to [encrypt and decrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption) data.

Use <ActionLink action='crypto.asymmetric.encrypt(keypair, data)'/> and <ActionLink action='crypto.asymmetric.decrypt(keypair, secret, data)'/> to encrypt and decrypt the data.

_Always use a strong and unique secret key._ Use a password manager such as LastPass or 1Password to help you create and keep track of them.

Keypairs are made up of a private key and a public key
The public key is a special value that can be used to encrypt data and
the private key is a related value that can be used to decrypt data that was encrypted by the private key.

The private key is called "private" because it is encrypted using the given secret
while the public key is called "public" because it is not encrypted so anyone can use it if they have access to it.

os.toast('Is it a keypair? ' + encrypted);
```

### `crypto.asymmetric.encrypt(keypair, data)`

[Encrypts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption) the given data using the given keypair's public key and returns the result.

Use the <ActionLink action='crypto.asymmetric.decrypt(keypair, secret, data)'/> function to decrypt the data.

This method will return a string of encrypted data that is confidential (unreadable without the keypair and secret used to encrypt it),
reliable (the encrypted data cannot be changed without making it unreadable), and authentic (decryptability proves that the keypair was used to encrypt the data).

As a consequence, encrypting the same data with the same keypair will produce different results.
This is to ensure that an attacker cannot correlate different pieces of data to potentially deduce the original plaintext.

Encrypts the given data using an asymmetric authenticated encryption mechanism
based on x25519 (A key-exchange mechanism), XSalsa20 (An encryption cipher) and Poly1305 (A message authentication code).

You may notice that this function does not need a secret to decrypt the keypair.
This is because the public key of the keypair is used to encrypt the data.
Due to how asymmetric encryption works, only the encrypted private key will be able to decrypt the data.

Encrypts the given data using an authenticated encryption mechanism 
based on [x25519](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve25519), [XSalsa20](https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/advanced/stream_ciphers/xsalsa20) (An encryption cipher) and [Poly1305](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poly1305) (A message authentication code).

The **first parameter** is the keypair that should be used to encrypt the data.

The **second parameter** is the string data that should be encrypted.

#### Examples

1. Encrypt the given data and toast it.
```typescript
const keypair = 'vEK1.UoNnUjLz7FdgjJ52P+f/sNw1VDsKwyX0kI+Bt7ivoF4=.djEuZmFvL0tOa1RJL3ByVm8wZ2QxYTk5clV4OXZUTk0wMnUuUHpZQUM1aVlYOUUra09vZ2hmamdyNll6T0tJS0ZjQjUuMGx2VGR5UmR2dloxUklWam5OODMrN09ibnk0c2MzbjNKYzZtSmFPYzc0ZXJXMlhHQzJsWW1vWGdFdzBRM2xkSg==';
const encrypted = crypto.asymmetric.encrypt(keypair, "hello, world");
os.toast(encrypted);
```

### `crypto.asymmetric.decrypt(keypair, secret, data)`

[Decrypts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption) the given data with the given keypair and secret and returns the result.
If the data was unable to be decrypted, null will be returned.

Use the <ActionLink action='crypto.asymmetric.encrypt(keypair, data)'/> function to encrypt the data.

The **first parameter** is the keypair that should be used to decrypt the data.

The **second parameter** is the secret that should be used to decrypt the keypair's private key.

The **third parameter** is the data that should be decrypted.

#### Examples:

1. Decrypt the given data and toast it.
```typescript
const keypair = 'vEK1.UoNnUjLz7FdgjJ52P+f/sNw1VDsKwyX0kI+Bt7ivoF4=.djEuZmFvL0tOa1RJL3ByVm8wZ2QxYTk5clV4OXZUTk0wMnUuUHpZQUM1aVlYOUUra09vZ2hmamdyNll6T0tJS0ZjQjUuMGx2VGR5UmR2dloxUklWam5OODMrN09ibnk0c2MzbjNKYzZtSmFPYzc0ZXJXMlhHQzJsWW1vWGdFdzBRM2xkSg==';
const encrypted = 'vA1.3CC1r0fJP2tPS09C8YrTDQCJmgFczxprNEcMOzY4JD4=.3oiC7nG6N4jblFhBd4usrdid/w4Phwg/.X/9mbZYOGBjRX7YAO4D2zYJvZ3c=';
const decrypted = crypto.asymmetric.decrypt(keypair, 'password', encrypted);
os.toast(decrypted);
```

### `crypto.asymmetric.isEncrypted(cyphertext)`

Determines if the given value was encrypted using <ActionLink action='crypto.asymmetric.encrypt(keypair, data)'/>.
Returns `true` if the data is a keypair and `false` otherwise.

The **first parameter** is the value that should be tested to see if it is encrypted.

#### Examples

1. Determine if a value is encrypted with asymmetric encryption.
```typescript
const encrypted = crypto.asymmetric.isEncrypted("hello, world");
os.toast('Is it encrypted? ' + encrypted);
```

### `crypto.createCertificate(certificate, secret, keypair)`

Creates a new certified bot (also known as a certificate) from the given keypair that is signed by the given certified bot using the given secret (also commonly known as a password).
Returns a promise that resolves with the new bot.

Certificates are useful for creating signatures for tag values that CasualOS is aware of and will validate for you.

Certificates are similar to keypairs except that they themselves are signed by another certificate.
This creates a [chain of trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_of_trust) that can be used to establish the validity of any arbitrary certificate.
The certificate that created the signature is called the "signing/signer certificate" and the certificate that recieved the signature is called the "signee certificate".

Each certificate contains the following information:

- A keypair.
- A reference to the signing certificate.
- A signature from the signing certificate.

In CasualOS, there are two types of certificates:

1. Root certificates.
2. Non-root certificates.

_Root certificates_ are certificates that are both signee and signer. This means that the certificate used its own keypair to create the signature.
As such, the validity of the certificate cannot be checked apart from simply trusting it. Only one root certificate is allowed per inst on a first-come first-serve basis.
Once a root certificate is created for a inst, another cannot be created.

_Non-root certificates_ are certificates that are signed by another certificate. This means that another certificate's keypair was used to create the signature.
As such, the validity of the certificate can be checked by following the chain of trust back to the root certificate.
If the chain does not end at the root certificate for the inst, then the certificate is invalid and any signatures created by it will also be invalid.

Use <ActionLink action='crypto.keypair(secret)'/> to create a keypair that can be used to create signatures.

Use <ActionLink action='crypto.signTag(certificate, secret, bot, tag)'/> to create signatures for a certificate.

The **first parameter** is the certified bot that should be used to sign the new certificate. If given null, then the new bot will be self-signed.

The **second parameter** is the secret that should be used to decrypt the private key. If the first parameter is null, then this should be the secret for the keypair.

The **third parameter** is the keypair that the new certificate should have.

#### Examples:

1. Create a root certificate and toast the Bot ID:
```typescript
const keypair = await crypto.keypair('secretForRootCert');
const cert = await crypto.createCertificate(null, 'secretForRootCert', keypair);

os.toast(getID(cert));
```

2. Create a non-root certificate and toast the Bot ID:
```typescript
const rootKeypair = getBot('id', rootCertID);

const nonRootKeypair = await crypto.keypair('secretForNonRootCert');
const nonRoot = await crypto.createCertificate(rootCert, 'secretForRootCert', nonRootKeypair);

os.toast(getID(nonRoot));
```

### `crypto.signTag(certificate, secret, bot, tag)`

Creates a signature for the given bot, tag, and current value using the given certificate and secret.
Returns a promise that resolves once the tag value has been signed.

When a signature is created for a tag value, the value is considered valid until it is changed or the certificate is revoked.

The **first parameter** is the certificate bot that should be used to create the signature.

The **second parameter** is the secret used to decrypt the private key of the certificate.

The **third parameter** is the bot whose tag value should be signed.

The **fourth parameter** is the tag whose value should be signed.

Use <ActionLink action='crypto.createCertificate(certificate, secret, keypair)'/> to create certificates that can be used with this function.

Use <ActionLink action='crypto.verifyTag(bot, tag)'/> to verify that a tag has a valid signature.

#### Examples:

1. Sign the `@onClick` script on a bot.
```typescript
const cert = getBot('id', certID);
await crypto.signTag(cert, 'secretForCert', bot, 'onClick');
```

### `crypto.verifyTag(bot, tag)`

Validates that the tag value stored in the given tag on the given bot has been signed by a valid certificate.
Returns true if the tag value is valid. Returns false otherwise.

The **first parameter** is the bot whose tag value should be checked.

The **second parameter** is the tag whose value should be checked.

#### Examples:

1. Check if the `@onClick` script is signed.
```typescript
const valid = crypto.verifyTag(bot, 'onClick');

if (valid) {
    os.toast('onClick is valid!');
} else {
    os.toast('onClick is not valid.');
}
```

### `crypto.revokeCertificate(certificate, secret, signer?)`

Revokes the given certificate and any signatures that it has created.
In effect, this deletes the certificate bot from the inst.
Additionally, any tags signed with the given certificate will no longer be verified.

Returns a promise that resolves when the certificate has been revoked.

Revoking a certificate works by creating another record (called a revocation) that is signed by either the original certificate 
or an ancestor of the original certificate. This record is then stored in the shared space and lets everyone see that the certificate is no longer valid.

The **first parameter** is the certificate that should be revoked.

The **second parameter** is the secret that should be used to decrypt the corresponding certificate's private key.
If the signer parameter is specified, then this is the secret for the signer certificate.
If the signer parameter is omitted, then this is the secret for the certificate that is being revoked.

The **third parameter** is optional and is the certificate that should be used to perform the revocation process.
If not specified, then the revocation will be signed by the revoked certificate (self-signed revocation).
If specified, then the revocation will be signed using the given certificate.
Note that any certificate that is specified must either be the original certificate or an ancestor of the original certificate.

#### Examples:

1. Revoke a certificate with itself.
```typescript
const cert = getBot('id', certificateId);
await crypto.revokeCertificate(cert, 'secretForCert');

os.toast('Certificate revoked!');
```

2. Revoke a certificate using another certificate.
```typescript
const certToRevoke = getBot('id', certToRevokeId);
const signingCert = getBot('id', signingCertId);

await crypto.revokeCertificate(certToRevoke, 'secretForSigningCert', signingCert);

os.toast('Certificate revoked!');
```

## Bytes Actions

Bytes actions are functions that make it easier to work with arrays of bytes and transform them into different formats.

### `bytes.toBase64String(bytes)`

Formats the given bytes into a string that contains the [Base64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) representation of the given data.
Returns the Base64 string.

The **first parameter** is the [Uint8Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Uint8Array) of bytes that should be formatted into Base64.

#### Examples:

```typescript title='Format a byte array into Base64'
os.toast(bytes.toBase64String(new Uint8Array([ 255, 254, 253 ])));
```

### `bytes.fromBase64String(base64)`

Converts the given [Base64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) string into a byte array that contains the data represented by the string.
Returns the new [Uint8Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Uint8Array) array.

The **first parameter** is the Base64 formatted string that should be converted to a [Uint8Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Uint8Array) byte array.

#### Examples:

```typescript title='Convert a Base64 string into bytes'
const data = bytes.fromBase64String('aGVsbG8='); // "hello" encoded in Base64
```

### `bytes.toHexString(bytes)`

Formats the given bytes into a string that contains the [hexadecimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal) representation of the given data.
Returns the hex string.

The **first parameter** is the [Uint8Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Uint8Array) of bytes that should be formatted into hexadecimal.

#### Examples:

```typescript title='Format a byte array into hexadecimal'
os.toast(bytes.toHexString(new Uint8Array([ 255, 254, 253 ]))); // fffefd in bytes
```

### `bytes.fromHexString(hex)`

Converts the given [hexadecimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal) string into a byte array that contains the data represented by the string.
Returns the new [Uint8Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Uint8Array) array.

The **first parameter** is the hexadecimal string that should be converted to a byte array.

#### Examples:

```typescript title='Convert a hex string into bytes'
const data = bytes.fromHexString('fffefd'); // 255, 254, 253 in hex
```

## App Actions

App actions are a way to register and display customized apps inside CasualOS.
They work in tandem with listen tags and bots to create arbitrarily complex experiences that interface with the CasualOS frontend.

Apps work by utilizing a subset of HTML that works in the CasualOS middle-end and can be synced to the CasualOS front-end. This allows
apps to leverage all the power of bots, tags, and tag masks while at the same time being able to seamlessly integrate with the front-end.

### `os.registerApp(appId, bot)`

Registers a app with the given ID, bot, and options. Returns a promise that resolves when the app has been registered.
Can be called multiple times with new options to override previous options.

Once setup, CasualOS will send a <TagLink tag='@onAppSetup'/> whisper to the given bot.
At this point, you can call <ActionLink action='os.compileApp(appId, content)'/> to set what the app displays.

CasualOS will also define a global variable `{app}Bot` that points to the given bot.

The **first parameter** is the ID that the app should have.

The **second parameter** is the bot that should represent the app. This is the bot that recieves the <TagLink tag='@onAppSetup'/> whisper and
should generally be in charge of calling <ActionLink action='os.compileApp(appId, content)'/>.

Apps work by running the HTML you give it by calling <ActionLink action='os.compileApp(appId, content)'/> with the HTML you want the app to show.
Since JavaScript does not natively support HTML, we are using a special extension called [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) that adds HTML-like syntax to JavaScript.
At the most basic, JSX is like writing HTML inside JavaScript:
```typescript
let htmlData = <div>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
</div>;
```
See this article for more information: [Introducing JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html)

CasualOS also includes a helper called `html` that can be used to make HTML objects out of a string.
You can use it to convert a string into HTML by adding it before a string that uses backticks, like this:
```typescript
let htmlData = html`
    <div>
        <h1>Hello World</h1>
    </div>
`;
```

JSX is the preferred way to write HTML inside JavaScript since CasualOS can properly detect it and add helpful features like syntax highlighting and error messages.

#### Examples:

```typescript title='Setup a basic app'
await os.registerApp('basicApp', thisBot);

os.compileApp('basicApp', <h1>Hello World!</h1>);
```

```typescript title='Setup an app with a button'
await os.registerApp('buttonApp', thisBot);

os.compileApp('buttonApp', 
    <button onClick={ () => os.toast("You clicked the button!") }>
        Click Me!
    </button>
);
```

```typescript title='Setup an app with an input box'
await os.registerApp('inputApp', thisBot);

os.compileApp('inputApp', 
    <input onInput={ (e) => { tags.label = e.target.value } }>
);
```

### `os.compileApp(appId, content)`

Compiles the app with the given ID to display the given content.
Each time this function is called, the app will be cleared and will display the specified content.

Used in tandem with <ActionLink action='os.registerApp(appId, bot)'/> to create custom apps.

The **first parameter** is the ID of the app.

The **second parameter** is the content that the app should display.

#### Examples:

```typescript title='Display a header'
os.compileApp('myApp', <h1>Hello World!</h1>);
```

```typescript title='Display a button'
os.compileApp('myApp', 
    <button onClick={ () => os.toast("You clicked the button!")}>
        Click Me!
    </button>
);
```

```typescript title='Display an input box'
os.compileApp('myApp', 
    <input onInput={ (e) => { tags.label = e.target.value } } />
);
```

```typescript title='Display a slider input'
os.compileApp('myApp', 
    <input type="range" min="0" max="100" onInput={ (e) => { tags.label = e.target.value } } />
);
```

### `os.unregisterApp(appId)`

Unregisters and removes the app with the given ID.
Returns a promise that resolves when the app has been removed.

The **first parameter** is the ID of the app.

#### Examples

```typescript title='Unregister an app'
await os.unregisterApp('myApp');
```

### `os.registerTagPrefix(prefix, options?)`

Specifies that the given prefix should be used to indicate that the tag contains script content.
Use this function to specify custom prefixes that function similarly to `@` or `🧬`.

The **first parameter** is the prefix that should indicate that the rest of the tag value is a script.

The **second parameter** is optional and is the options that should be used for the prefix. It is an object and should have the following structure:
```typescript
let options: {

    /**
     * The language that scripts with the prefix should be interpreted as.
     * 
     * "javascript" and "typescript" can be used for general purpose programming.
     * 
     * "jsx" and "tsx" are extensions to JavaScript and TypeScript which includes the ability
     * to write HTML-like code that gets converted to JavaScript/TypeScript code.
     * 
     * "json" can be used to interpret the data as JSON (like 🧬).
     * 
     * "text" can be used to interpret the data as plain text.
     * 
     * Defaults to "javascript".
     */
    language?: "javascript" | "typescript" | "json" | "jsx" | "tsx" | "text";
};
```

#### Examples:

1. Add `📖` as an script prefix.
```typescript
await os.registerTagPrefix("📖");
```

2. Register some arbitrary text as a prefix.
```typescript
await os.registerTagPrefix("myPrefix");
```

3. Register a prefix as [JSX code](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html).
```typescript
await os.registerTagPrefix("🔺", {
    language: "jsx"
});
```

## Experimental Actions

### `experiment.localFormAnimation(bot, animation)`

### `experiment.localPositionTween(bot, dimension, position, easing?)`

Locally plays a tween that moves the given bot in the given dimension to the given position.
Optionally allows customizing the easing of the tween.

Returns a promise that resolves when the tween is finished.

While the tween is playing, any updates to the bot's position and rotation are ignored.
Once the tween is done playing, any change to the bot will reset the position/rotation.

The **first parameter** is the bot or ID of the bot that should be tweened.

The **second parameter** is the dimension that the bot should be tweened in.
Note that the tween will only work if the given dimension is currently in the grid portal or miniGridPortal.

        }
    });
```

### `experiment.localRotationTween(bot, dimension, rotation, easing?)`

Locally plays a tween that rotates the given bot in the given dimension to the given rotation.
Optionally allows customizing the easing of the tween.

Returns a promise that resolves when the tween is finished.

While the tween is playing, any updates to the bot's position and rotation are ignored.
Once the tween is done playing, any change to the bot will reset the position/rotation.

The **first parameter** is the bot or ID of the bot that should be tweened.

The **second parameter** is the dimension that the bot should be tweened in.
Note that the tween will only work if the given dimension is currently in the grid portal or miniGridPortal.
