## abCore Functions

### `shout("abPublishAB", options); || whisper(abStore, "abPublishAB", options);`
Publishes a file and associates it with the egg record addressed to the specified app bundle (ab).  Returns a boolean based on success or failure.
```typescript
let options: {
    /**
    * The ab ID of the egg you would like associated with the app bundle.
    */
    ab: "string";

    /**
    * The key used to encrypt/decrypt the file data.
    * If omitted, then the file will be unencrypted.
    */
    key?: "string";

    /**
    * If set to true, will make the egg publicly readable
    */
    publicFacing?: boolean;

    /**
    * The bot(s) to publish in the file.
    * If omitted, then all non AB bots in the shared space will be used.
    */
    target?: [array];
};
```

#### Examples
```typescript title="Publish an egg via shout"
let myAB = shout("abPublishAB",{
    ab: "myABID"
});
```

```typescript title="Publish an encrypted egg via whisper"
let myAB = whisper(abStore,"abPublishAB",{
    ab: "myABID",
    key: "myPassword"
});
```

```typescript title="Publish a specific bot in an egg via whisper"
let myBot = getBot("myBotTag");
let myAB = await whisper(abStore,"abPublishAB",{
    ab: "myABID",
    target: myBot
});
os.toast(myAB);
```

### `shout("hatch", {abID: abID, recordKey: studio, key: key, autoHatch: boolean, returnType: data/null, eggParameters: arg});`
Allows the user to look up and/or hatch an egg.
```typescript
let options: {
    /**
    * The ab that you want loaded.
    */
    abID : "string";

    /**
    * This is the studio that the egg record and file is held in.
    * If not included, will use the authBot id (the player studio).
    */
    recordKey?: "string";

    /**
    * Desired key for optional encryption.
    */
    key?: "string";

    /**
    * If set to true, will automatically hatch the ab into the current experience.
    */
    autoHatch?: boolean;

    /**
    * If set to data, will return the ab as data instead of as an egg or bots.
    */
    returnType?: "data";
    
    /**
    * This is an argument that will be passed through to the ab bots inside of onEggHatch.
    */
    eggParameters?: "string or object";
};
```

#### Examples
```typescript title="Bring in an egg using a shout"
let getEgg = shout("onLookupabEggs",{
    abID: "myABID"
});
```

```typescript title="Hatch an encrypted egg automatically via whisper"
let hatchEgg = whisper(abRecordSearch, "onLookupabEggs",{
    abID: "myABID",
    key: "myPassword",
    autoHatch: true
});
```

```typescript title="Return data via a whisper"
let abData = whisper(abRecordSearch, "onLookupabEggs",{
    abID: "myABID",
    returnType: "data"
});
console.log(abData)
```

### `shout("focus", {bot: bot, position: {x: number, y: number}, duration: number, zoom: number, rotation: object, easing: {type: string, mode: string}});`
A helper function to more easily interface with `os.focusOn()`.  Please see documentation for `os.focusOn()` for optional options.
```typescript
let options: {
    /**
    * The the bot that the camera should move to.
    */
    bot?: bot;

    /**
    * The position that the camera should move to.
    * Only used if no bot is provided.
    */
    position?: object;
};
```

### `shout("showConsole");`
A shout to open the abCore chat log.

### `shout('hideConsole');`
A shout to close the abCore chat log.


## abCore Listener Tags

### `onABInitialized`
A superShout sent out when AB has finished booting.
```typescript title="Arguments"
let that = {
    inst: "inst AB booted in"
};
```

### `onEggHatch`
A whisper that is sent to any bots that are hatched (manually or automatically) from an ab.
```typescript title="Arguments"
let that = {
    ab: "egg name",
    version: "egg version number",
    inst: "inst it was hatched in",
    eggParameters: "any arguments passed in via hatch()"
};
```

### `onPreHatch`
A shout that is sent after an ab has been added, but before the ab origin tag has been assigned.  Allows for manual determiniation of full boot up if returned true.

### `onAbAdded`
A superShout that occurs anytime an ab is added to the inst.
```typescript title="Arguments"
let that = {
    ab: "ab name",
    version: "ab version number",
    inst: "inst it was hatched in"
};
```

### `onAbPublished`
A superShout sent out when an ab is published.
```typescript title="Arguments"
let that = {
    success: boolean,
    ab: "string",
    fileAddress: "string"
};
```


## abCore Settings Tags

### `abIgnore`
Tag that when set to 'true' will not be included in a general publish or download of an inst.

### `abBotSnapState`
By default, AB sets an os.addDropSnap (face) on any bot that is being dragged.  
This can be turned off/on either through the AB self select or by directly manipulating the variable on `abRemember`.

#### Examples
```typescript title="Remove AB bot snap"
abRemember.tags.abBotSnapState = false;
```

```typescript title="Turn AB bot snap on"
abRemember.tags.abBotSnapState = "face";
```

### `baseAB`
A tag on the abRemember that rememembers the original pattern loaded (if hatched through the URL parameters).

### `abGridSnapState`
By default, AB sets an os.addDropSnap (grid) on any bot that is being dragged.  
This can be turned off/on either through the AB self select or by directly manipulating the variable on `abRemember`.

#### Examples
```typescript title="Remove AB grid snap"
abRemember.tags.abGridSnapState = false;
```

```typescript title="Turn AB grid snap on"
abRemember.tags.abGridSnapState = true;
```


## AB URL Variables

### `pattern`
When set as a variable in the URL and opening the inst for the first time, this will automatically load the specified ab from records using either the defined studio or the authBot id.

### `studio`
When set in the URL, this will be used to load any patterns unless otherwise directed.

### `key`
When set as a variable in the URL, allows for automatic opening of the matching encrypted ab.

### `abVersion`
Can be used to target a specific version of an egg/ab when using pattern in the URL.

### `prompt`
Can be used to replace the default ask prompt in AB.

### `ask`
A global pattern containing specific public patterns.  Will behave like the `pattern` variable if no global pattern is found.


## Nuggets

### abNugget / nuggets
This is a skill inside of AB that allows loading and publishing of code snippets while in the sheet, tag, or system portal.  It utilizes the codeButton form to offer several options to users while scripting in a tag.  This skill is present but not active when loading AB in a development environment.

### `{}`
To load a nugget, you can put the name of a nugget (no spaces) inside a set of brackets.  Adding a period and v with a number to the end of the nugget name (.v#) allows the user to specify the version of the nugget that they would like to load.

#### Examples
```typescript title="loading a nugget"
{hello}//loads the latest version of hello
```

```typescript title="loading a nugget, version defined"
{hello.v1} //loads hello version 1
```

### `.nug {}`
To publish a nugget, you use a similar format to loading with the addition of .nug and a space before it.  Then, using the cursor, highlight the segment you wish to publish.  With it still highlighted, presse the codeButton.
```typescript title="publishing a nugget"
.nug {myNugget}
```


## AB Chat Commands

### `.sleep`
Put AB in a sleep state (default state when a pattern is loaded).

### `..`
Put AB in an awake state (listening).

### `.system`
Open the system portal.

### `.sheet`
Open sheet portal for currently active grid or map portal.

### `.menuSheet`
Open sheet portal for active menu portal.

### `.download`
Use AB's download function.

### `.upload`
Open and upload a file via a file picker.
