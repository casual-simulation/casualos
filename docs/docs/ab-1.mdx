## ab-1 Helper Variables

### `abRemember`

References the instMemory bot, which holds on to inst specific data for ab-1 (i.e. ab-1 sleep state, bot snap state, and grid snap state).

### `abRecordSearch`

References the search bot, which handles various aspects of looking up records.

### `abStore`

References the publish bot, which has several interfaces for initiating uploads via ab-1.

## ab-1 Functions

### `shout("abPublishAB", options); || whisper(abStore, "abPublishAB", options);`

Publishes a file and associates it with the egg addressed to the specified abID.  Returns a boolean based on success or failure.

```typescript
let options: {
    /**
    * The abID of the egg you would like associated with the app bundle.
    */
    ab: "string";

    /**
    * The key used to encrypt/decrypt the file data.
    * If omitted, then the file will be unencrypted.
    */
    Key?: "string";

    /**
    * The bot(s) to publish in the file.
    * If omitted, then all non ab-1 bots in the shared space will be used.
    */
    target?: [array];
};
```

#### Examples

```typescript title="Publish an AB via shout"
let myAB = shout("abPublishAB",{
    ab: "myABID"
});
```

```typescript title="Publish an encrypted AB via whisper"
let myAB = whisper(abStore,"abPublishAB",{
    ab: "myABID",
    key: "myPassword"
});
```

```typescript title="Publish a specific bot AB via whisper"
let myBot = getBot("myBotTag");

let myAB = await whisper(abStore,"abPublishAB",{
    ab: "myABID",
    target: myBot
});

os.toast(myAB);
```


### `shout("abAddToFactory", options);`

Adds a template bot, while consuming the target bot, to the abFactory menu.

```typescript
let options: {
    /**
    * The bot to be added as a factory template.
    */
    bot : bot;

    /**
    * The dimension that the target bot should be removed from.
    */
    dimension: "string";

    /**
    * The id that the bot will be listed in the ab factory under.
    */
    factoryID: "string";
};
```

#### Examples

```typescript title="Adding a bot to the factory"
let myFactoryTemplate = shout("abAddToFactory",{
    bot: myBot,
    dimension: "home",
    factoryID: "myTemplate"
});
```

### `shout("abCreateFromFactory", options);`

Adds a bot from a template in the abFactory.

```typescript
let options: {
    /**
    * Mods to determine a dimension for the bot to manifest.
    */
    position : {

    /**
    * The dimension that the target bot should be added to.
    */
    dimension: "string";

    /**
    * The x position in the above specified dimension.
    */
    x: number;

    /**
    * The y position in the above specified dimension.
    */
    y: number;
    }
};
```

#### Examples

```typescript title="Creating a bot from a factory"
let myFactoryTemplate = shout("abCreateFromFactory",{
    factoryID: "myTemplate",
    position: {
        dimension: "home",
        x: 0,
        y: 0
    }
});
```

### `shout("onLookupabEggs", {abID: abID, key: key, autoHatch: boolean, returnType: data/null});`

Allows the user to search for and/or hatch an ab.

```typescript
let options: {
    /**
    * The ab that you want loaded.
    */
    abID : "string";

    /**
    * Desired key for optional encryption.
    */
    key?: "string";

    /**
    * If set to true, will automatically hatch the ab into the current experience.
    */
    autoHatch?: boolean;

    /**
    * If set to data, will return the ab as data instead of as an egg or bots.
    */
    returnType?: "data";    
};
```

#### Examples

```typescript title="Bring in an egg using a shout"
let getEgg = shout("onLookupabEggs",{
    abID: "myABID"
});
```

```typescript title="Hatch an encrypted egg automatically via whisper"
let hatchEgg = whisper(abRecordSearch, "onLookupabEggs",{
    abID: "myABID",
    key: "myPassword",
    autoHatch: true
});
```

```typescript title="Return data via a whisper"
let abData = whisper(abRecordSearch, "onLookupabEggs",{
    abID: "myABID",
    returnType: "data"
});

console.log(abData)
```


## ab-1 Specific Tags

### `onEggHatch`

A whisper that is sent to any bots that are hatched (whether manually or automatically) from an ab.

```typescript title="Arguments"
let that = {
    ab: "ab name",
    version: "ab version number"
};
```

### `onPreHatch`

A shout that is sent after an ab has been added, but before the ab-1 ab tag has been assigned.  Allows for manual determiniation of full boot up if returned true.

### `onAbAdded`

A shout that occurs anytime an ab is added to the inst.

```typescript title="Arguments"
let that = {
    ab: "ab name",
    version: "ab version number"
};
```

### `onABPublished`

A shout sent out when an ab is published.

```typescript title="Arguments"
let that = {
    ab: "string",
    fileAddress: "string"
};
```

### `abIgnore`

Tag that when set to 'true' will not be included in a general publish or download of an inst.

## ab-1 Environment Tags

### `abBotSnapState`
By default, ab-1 sets an os.addDropSnap (face) on any bot that is being dragged.  

This can be turned off/on either through the ab-1 self select or by directly manipulating the variable on abRemember.

#### Examples

```typescript title="Remove ab-1 bot snap"
abRemember.tags.abBotSnapState = false;
```

```typescript title="Turn ab-1 bot snap on"
abRemember.tags.abBotSnapState = "face";
```

### `baseAB`
A tag on the abRemember that determines if the ab/autoLoad/auxCode has been loaded yet.  Can be set by user using the "onConfirmHatch" shout and passing through the ab name.

### `abGridSnapState`
By default, ab-1 sets an os.addDropSnap (grid) on any bot that is being dragged.  

This can be turned off/on either through the ab-1 self select or by directly manipulating the variable on abRemember.

#### Examples

```typescript title="Remove ab-1 grid snap"
abRemember.tags.abGridSnapState = false;
```

```typescript title="Turn ab-1 grid snap on"
abRemember.tags.abGridSnapState = true;
```


## ab-1 URL Variables

### `ab`
When set as a variable in the URL and opening the inst for the first time, this will automatically load the specified ab from records.

### `key`
When set as a variable in the URL, allows ab/autoLoad/auxCode to open an encrypted ab.

### `abVersion`
Can be used to target a specific version of an ab when using ab/autoLoad/auxCode in the URL.

### `prompt`
Can be used to replace the default ask prompt in ab-1.


## Nuggets

### `abNugget` / nuggets
This is a skill inside of ab-1 that allows loading and publishing of code snippets while in the sheet, tag, or system portal.  It utilizes the codeButton form to offer several options to users while scripting in a tag.  This skill is present but not active when loading ab-1 in a development environment.

### `{name}`
To load a nugget, you can put the name of a nugget (no spaces) inside a set of brackets.  Adding a period and v with a number to the end of the nugget name (.v#) allows the user to specify the version of the nugget that they would like to load.

#### Examples

```typescript title="loading a nugget"
{hello}//loads the latest version of hello
```

```typescript title="loading a nugget, version defined"
{hello.v1} //loads hello version 1
```

### `.nug {}`
To publish a nugget, you use a similar format to loading with the addition of .nug and a space before it.  Then, using the cursor, highlight the segment you wish to publish.  With it still highlighted, presse the codeButton.

```typescript title="publishing a nugget"
.nug {myNugget}
```
