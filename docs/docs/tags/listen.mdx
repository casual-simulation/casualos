Listen tags are tags that can receive shouts and whispers from other bots and actions that happen from the user.
To create a listen tag, you make a normal tag and enter a "@" as the first character of the tag's value.

Each listen tag has some predefined variables that can be used. You can read about those [here](../variables.mdx).

## Whisper Tags

Whispers are shouts that are sent to specific bots instead of all bots.

### `@onCreate`

A whisper that is sent to a bot when it is first created.

### `@onDestroy`

A whisper that is sent to a bot when it is being destroyed.

### `@onModDrop`

A whisper that is sent to a bot that a mod was dropped on.
If a custom `@onModDrop` is not specified, then the mod will be applied automatically.
If a custom `@onModDrop` is specified, then the mod needs to be applied manually via <ActionLink action='applyMod(bot, ...mods)'/>.

#### Arguments:
```typescript
interface Mod {
  [tag: string]: any;
}

let that: {
  mod: Mod
};
```

### `@onModDropEnter`

A whisper that is sent to the bot that a mod started to be dragged onto.

#### Arguments:
```typescript
let that: {
  mod: Mod,
  dimension: string
};
```

### `@onModDropExit`

A whisper that is sent to the bot that a mod was just dragged off of.

#### Arguments:
```typescript
let that: {
  mod: Mod,
  dimension: string
};
```

Only sent for bots that are in a menu and have <TagLink tag='form'/> set to `input`.

#### Arguments:
```typescript
let that: {
  text: string
};
```

### `@onSubmit`

A whisper that is sent whenever the player submits the text in the menu bot's input box.
This can happen by pressing enter while there is text in the box or by clicking the send button on the right side of the box.

Only sent for bots that are in a menu and have <TagLink tag='form'/> set to `input`.

#### Arguments:
```typescript
let that: {
  text: string
};
```

### `@onSetupApp`

A whisper that is sent when a [custom app](../actions/os/app.mdx) has been setup.
Called when <ActionLink action='os.registerApp(appId, bot)'/> has completed its work.

#### Arguments:
```typescript
let that: {
    /**
     * The HTML document that has been setup for the app
     * See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLDocument
     */
    document: Document
};
```

### `@onBotAdded`

A whisper that is sent when the bot is added to the local inst.

Unlike <TagLink tag='@onCreate'/>, this listen tag is triggered whenever the bot as been added to the current device's inst, even if the bot has already been created.
An example of this happening is when you first load an inst. Even though all the bots have already been created, they still need to be added to the inst in order for you to interact with them.

Note that this listen tag is triggered after executing scripts have finished running. This means that if a script creates multiple bots, `@onBotAdded` will be triggered after all the bots have been created.
This is in contrast to <TagLink tag='@onCreate'/> which is triggered immediately after the bot has been created.

Also note that this listen tag can be triggered before <TagLink tag='@onInstJoined'/>. This means that it is possible for bots in other spaces to not be available when this listener is triggered.

There is no `that` argument for this listen tag.

### `@onBotChanged`

A whisper that is sent when a tag on the bot is updated.

This listen tag is triggered whenever the bot has been updated in the current device's inst, even if the bot was not updated locally.
An example of this happening is when another player changes a tag in the sheet portal. Even though the change was not made on their device, it will show up on the current device.

Note that this listen tag is triggered after executing scripts have finished running. This means that if a script updates the same tag multiple times, `@onBotChanged` will still only be triggered once.
This is in contrast to <TagLink tag='@onCreate'/> which is triggered immediately after the bot has been created.

Additionally, if the bot was created and then immediately updated, `@onBotChanged` will not be triggered. Instead, use <TagLink tag='@onBotAdded'/>.

Also note that this listen tag can be triggered before <TagLink tag='@onInstJoined'/>. This means that it is possible for bots in other spaces to not be available when this listener is triggered.

#### Arguments:
```typescript
let that: {
    /**
     * The list of tags that were changed on the bot.
     */
    tags: string[]
};
```

### `@[groupName][stateName]OnEnter`

A whisper that is sent whenever the `[groupName]` tag is set to `[stateName]` via the <ActionLink action='changeState(bot, stateName, groupName?)'/> function.

#### Arguments:
```typescript
let that: {
  /**
   * The stateName that the bot is coming from.
   */
  from: string,

  /**
   * The stateName that the bot is going to.
   */
  to: string,
};
```

### `@[groupName][stateName]OnExit`

A whisper that is sent whenever the `[groupName]` tag is changed from `[stateName]` via the <ActionLink action='changeState(bot, stateName, groupName?)'/> function.

#### Arguments:
```typescript
let that: {
  /**
   * The stateName that the bot is coming from.
   */
  from: string,

  /**
   * The stateName that the bot is going to.
   */
  to: string,
};
```

### `@onFormAnimationStarted`

A whisper that is sent whenever an animation is started via the <ActionLink action='os.startFormAnimation(botOrBots, nameOrIndex, options?)'/> function.

#### Arguments:
```typescript
let that: {
    /**
     * The animation that was started.
     */
    animation: string | number;
};
```

### `@onFormAnimationStopped`

A whisper that is sent whenever an animation is stopped via the <ActionLink action='os.stopFormAnimation(botOrBots, options?)'/> function.

#### Arguments:
```typescript
let that: {
    /**
     * The animation that was stopped.
     */
    animation: string | number;
};
```

### `@onFormAnimationLooped`

A whisper that is sent whenever an animation finishes and starts to repeat based on the loop rules given to <ActionLink action='os.startFormAnimation(botOrBots, nameOrIndex, options?)'/> in the options.

#### Arguments:
```typescript
let that: {
    /**
     * The animation that was looped.
     */
    animation: string | number;

    /**
     * The number of loops that have been completed.
     */
    loopCount: number;
};
```

### `@onFormAnimationFinished`

A whisper that is sent whenever an animation that was started by <ActionLink action='os.startFormAnimation(botOrBots, nameOrIndex, options?)'/> stops.
This whisper is sent both for when the animation is manually stopped (by calling <ActionLink action='os.stopFormAnimation(botOrBots, options?)'/>) and also when it stops because it shouldn't repeat.

#### Arguments:
```typescript
let that: {
    /**
     * The animation that finished.
     */
    animation: string | number;
};
```

     * The name of the room that the user exited.
     */
    roomName: string;

     * The argument that was included in the message.
     */
    that: any,

    /**
     * The ID of the remote device that sent the message.
     */
    remoteId: string
};
```

#### Examples:

1. Show a toast when a "custom" message is received.
```typescript
if (that.name === "custom") {
    os.toast("Got message from " + that.remoteId + " with " + that.that);
}
```

2. Send a message back to the remote that sent the message.

if (that.name === "hello") {
    sendRemoteData(that.remoteId, "hi");
}
```

### `@onRemoteJoined`

A shout that is run on every other remote device when it joins the current server.

Since this shout is run on every device, you should be careful about performing duplicate actions.
When in doubt, elect a remote to perform all actions that should only be executed once.
See example 2 below.

#### Arguments:
```typescript
let that: {
    /**
     * The ID of the remote that joined the server.
     */
    remoteId: string
};
```

#### Examples:

1. Show a toast when a remote joins.
```typescript
os.toast("Remote joined: " + that.remoteId);
```

### `@onRemoteLeave`

A shout that is run on every other remote device when it leaves the current server.

Since this shout is run on every device, you should be careful about performing duplicate actions.
When in doubt, elect a remote to perform all actions that should only be executed once.
See example 2 below.

#### Arguments:
```typescript
let that: {
    /**
     * The ID of the remote that left the server.
     */
    remoteId: string
};
```

#### Examples:

1. Show a toast when a player leaves.
```typescript
os.toast("Remote joined: " + that.remoteId);
```

### `@onAnyBotsAdded`

A shout that is sent when a list of bots is added to the current server.

Unlike <TagLink tag='@onAnyCreate'/>, this listen tag is triggered whenever the bots have been added to the current device's server, even if the bots have already been created.
An example of this happening is when you first load a server. Even though all the bots have already been created, they still need to be added to the server in order for you to interact with them.

Note that this listen tag is triggered after executing scripts have finished running. This means that if a script updates the same tag multiple times, `@onAnyBotsAdded` will still only be triggered once.
This is in contrast to <TagLink tag='@onCreate'/> which is triggered immediately after the bot has been created.

Also note that this listen tag can be triggered before <TagLink tag='@onInstJoined'/>. This means that it is possible for bots in other spaces to not be available when this listener is triggered.

#### Arguments:
```typescript
let that: {
    /**
     * The array of bots that were added to the server.
     */
    bots: Bot[];
};
```

### `@onAnyBotsRemoved`

A shout that is sent when a list of bots is removed from the current server.

Unlike <TagLink tag='@onDestroy'/>, this listen tag is triggered whenever the bots have been removed from the current device's server, even if the bots were not destroyed.
An example of this happening is when another player disconnects. Even though their config bots were not destroyed, they still need to be removed from the server.

Note that this listen tag is triggered after executing scripts have finished running. This means that if a script updates the same tag multiple times, `@onAnyBotsRemoved` will still only be triggered once.
This is in contrast to <TagLink tag='@onCreate'/> which is triggered immediately after the bot has been created.

Also note that this listen tag can be triggered before <TagLink tag='@onInstJoined'/>. This means that it is possible for bots in other spaces to not be available when this listener is triggered.

#### Arguments:
```typescript
let that: {
    /**
     * The array of bot IDs that were removed from the server.
     */
    botIDs: string[];
};
```

### `@onAnyBotsChanged`

A shout that is sent when one or more tags are changed on a list of bots in the current server.

This listen tag is triggered whenever the bots have been updated in the current device's server, even if the bots were not updated locally.
An example of this happening is when another player changes a tag in the sheet portal. Even though the change was made on their device, it will show up on the current device.

Note that this listen tag is triggered after executing scripts have finished running. This means that if a script updates the same tag multiple times, `@onAnyBotsChanged` will still only be triggered once.
This is in contrast to <TagLink tag='@onCreate'/> which is triggered immediately after the bot has been created.

Additionally, a bot was created and then immediately updated, `@onAnyBotsChanged` will not be triggered for that bot. Instead, use <TagLink tag='@onAnyBotsAdded'/>.

Also note that this listen tag can be triggered before <TagLink tag='@onInstJoined'/>. This means that it is possible for bots in other spaces to not be available when this listener is triggered.

#### Arguments:
```typescript
let that: {
    /**
     * The bot that was updated.
     */
    bot: Bot,

    /**
     * The list of tags that were changed on the bot.
     */
    tags: string[]
}[];
```

### `@onError`

A shout that is sent when an unhandled error occurs in a listen tag.
Errors can occur for many reasons, but common ones include data being unexpectedly missing (e.g. "Cannot read property xyz of undefined") or invalid usage (e.g. "xyz is not a function").

Note that errors which occur in a `@onError` listen tag will not trigger further `onError` calls.
To view those errors, open the developer tools console.

#### Arguments:
```typescript
let that: {
    /**
     * The bot that the error originated from.
     */
    bot: Bot,

    /**
     * The tag that the error originated from.
     */
    tag: string,

    /**
     * The error that occurred.
     */
    error: Error
}
```

### `@onRoomJoined`

        video: boolean;

        /**
         * Whether the audio will stream when the room is joined.
         */
        audio: boolean;
    
        /**
         * Whether the screen will stream when the room is joined..
         */
        screen?: boolean;
    };
};
```

### `@onRoomLeave`

A shout that is sent whenever a multimedia chat room is exited by using <ActionLink action='os.leaveRoom(roomName, options?)'/>.

#### Arguments:
```typescript
let that: {
    /**
     * The name of the room that was left.

#### Arguments:
```typescript
let that: {
    /**
     * The name of the room that lost connection.
     */
    roomName: string;
};
```

### `@onRoomTrackSubscribed`

A shout that is sent whenever a media track is discovered inside a multimedia chat room.

#### Arguments:
```typescript
let that: {
    /**
     * The bot that the animation was stopped on.
     */

     */
    animation: string | number;
};
```

### `@onAnyFormAnimationLooped`

#### Arguments:
```typescript
let that: {
    /**
     * The bot that the animation was looped on.
     */
    bot: Bot;

    /**
     * The animation that was looped.

};
```

### `@onAnyFormAnimationFinished`

A shout that is sent to all bots whenever an animation that was started by <ActionLink action='os.startFormAnimation(botOrBots, nameOrIndex, options?)'/> stops.
This shout is sent both for when the animation is manually stopped (by calling <ActionLink action='os.stopFormAnimation(botOrBots, options?)'/>) and also when it stops because it shouldn't repeat.

#### Arguments:
```typescript
let that: {
    /**
     * The bot that the animation was finished on.
     */
    bot: Bot;

    /**

     */
    animation: string | number;
};
```

### `@onDocumentAvailable`

A shout that is sent to all bots when the [Document](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document) object is made available to scripts.

#### Arguments:
```typescript
let that: null;
```

### `@onSpaceMaxSizeReached`

A shout that is sent to all bots when a space rejects persistent storage of one or more bot changes due to exceeding the storage limits of the space.

There are a several consequences to this:

-   Some bot/tag changes were not persistently stored in the space.
-   Those same bot/tag changes will still be available on the machine that the change was created on, as long as the browser tab has not been reloaded.
-   Future changes to that space may or may not be persisted, depending on whether the individual changes would cause the space to exceed its storage limit. As a result, large changes are more likely to be rejected than small changes.

As such, if this shout occurs in an inst that you are working in, it is highly recommended to make a manual backup so that you don't loose any data.

#### Arguments:
```typescript
let that: {
    /**
     * The space that rejected some changes due to storage limits.
     * Generally, this is the "shared" space.
     */
    space: string;

    /**
     * The storage limit for the space. Represented in bytes.
     */
    maxSizeInBytes: number;

    /**
     * The number of bytes that the storage limit would need to be in order to accept the changes.
     */
    neededSizeInBytes: number;
};
```

### `@onSpaceRateLimitExceeded`

A shout that is sent to all bots when a space rejects a change because it would exceed the rate limit for the space.

Rate limits are used to prevent too many changes at one time from overloading the system, and they only apply to the `shared` space.

#### Arguments:
```typescript
let that: {
    /**
     * The space that rejected some changes/messages due to rate limits.
     */
    space: string;
}
```
### `@onCollaborationEnabled`

A shout that is sent to all bots when collaboration becomes enabled for the current inst.

### `@onAllowCollaborationUpgrade`

A shout that is sent to all bots when <ActionLink action='os.enableCollaboration'/> is able to be called.

### `@onDisallowCollaborationUpgrade`

A shout that is sent to all bots when <ActionLink action='os.enableCollaboration'/> is no longer able to be called.

### `@onResolveModule`

A shout that is sent to all bots when a module is being resolved.
Used to resolve statements like `import { foo } from 'myCustomModule'`.

In the case that multiple bots are listening for this shout, the first bot to resolve a non-null value will be used.
If none of the bots return a valid value, then the default mechanism for resolving modules will be used.

The default mechanism for resolving modules is as follows:
-   Scripts based on system tag. You can import exported functions and variables from any script based on the system tag of its bot. For example, `import {abc} from "example.system.tag"` can be used to import the `abc` variable or function from the bot with the `example.system` system and the `tag` tag.
-   URLs. The URLs can be imported. For example, `import { sortBy } from 'https://esm.run/lodash-es';"` imports the [`sortBy` function](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#sortBy) from the [`lodash-es` module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash-es) provided by [https://esm.run](https://esm.run).

#### Arguments:
```typescript
let that: {
    /**
     * The module that is being imported.
     */
    module: string;

    /**
     * The metadata for the import.
     */
    meta: {
        /**
         * The ID of the bot that is importing this module.
        */
        botId?: string;

        /**
         * The ID of the space that is importing this module.
        */
        tag?: string;
    }
};
```

Should return an object with the following form:

```typescript
/**
 * The type that should be returned.
 * It can be one of four different types:
 * - An object that references the bot and a tag that the module is defined in.
 * - An object that contains a set of exports.
 * - A string that contains the source code of the module.
 * - A string that contains the URL that the module can be accessed at.
*/
type ResolvedBotModule =
    | IdentifiedBotModule
    | ExportsBotModule
    | string;

/**
 * The type of object that should be returned if the module is attached to a script tag on a bot.
*/
interface IdentifiedBotModule {
    /**
     * The ID of the bot.
    */
    botId: string;

    /**
     * The tag that the module is defined in.
    */
    tag: string;
}

/**
 * The type of object that should be returned if the module is a set of exports.
*/
interface ExportsBotModule {
    /**
     * The exports of the module.
    */
    [key: string]: any;
}
```

#### Examples:

```typescript title="Return a module that is defined on a bot."
if (that.module === 'myCustomModule') {
    return {
        botId: "abc-123",
        tag: "myModule"
    };
}
```

```typescript title="Return a set of exports for the module"
if (that.module === 'myCustomModule') {
    return {
        exports: {
            num: 123,
            myFunc: () => os.toast('hello from myFunc()')
        }
    };
}
```

```typescript title="Return the source code of the module"
if (that.module === 'myCustomModule') {
    return `
        export const num = 123;
        export function myFunc() {
            os.toast('hello from myFunc()');
        }
    `;
}
```

```typescript title="Return the URL of the module"
if (that.module === 'myCustomModule') {
    return 'https://example.com/myCustomModule.js';
}
```
