Welcome to CasualOS!

CasualOS is a tool to help us solve problems and test out different possible solutions.
To do this, we need to harness the power of automation.
We know this can be a tricky thing to understand, so we've created a series of videos to teach you how automation works and how you can create experiences that leverage automation.

We call these videos "The Pillars of Casual Simulation" and they focus on introducing the core concepts of computing and automation.
As you go along, you will learn how to use CasualOS and will become familiar with many of the words, concepts, and values that CasualOS utilizes.
