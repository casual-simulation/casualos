Listen tags are tags that can receive shouts and whispers from other bots and actions that happen from the user.
To create a listen tag, you make a normal tag and enter a "@" as the first character of the tag's value.

Each listen tag has some predefined variables that can be used. You can read about those [here](./variables.mdx).

    /**
     * The HTML document that has been setup for the app
     * See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLDocument
     */
    document: Document
};
```

### `@onBotAdded`

A whisper that is sent when the bot is added to the local inst.

Unlike <TagLink tag='@onCreate'/>, this listen tag is triggered whenever the bot as been added to the current device's inst, even if the bot has already been created.
An example of this happening is when you first load an inst. Even though all the bots have already been created, they still need to be added to the inst in order for you to interact with them.

Note that this listen tag is triggered after executing scripts have finished running. This means that if a script creates multiple bots, `@onBotAdded` will be triggered after all the bots have been created.
This is in contrast to <TagLink tag='@onCreate'/> which is triggered immediately after the bot has been created.

Also note that this listen tag can be triggered before <TagLink tag='@onInstJoined'/>. This means that it is possible for bots in other spaces to not be available when this listener is triggered.

There is no `that` argument for this listen tag.

### `@onBotChanged`

A whisper that is sent when a tag on the bot is updated.

This listen tag is triggered whenever the bot has been updated in the current device's inst, even if the bot was not updated locally.
An example of this happening is when another player changes a tag in the sheet portal. Even though the change was made on their device, it will show up on the current device.

Note that this listen tag is triggered after executing scripts have finished running. This means that if a script updates the same tag multiple times, `@onBotChanged` will still only be triggered once.
This is in contrast to <TagLink tag='@onCreate'/> which is triggered immediately after the bot has been created.

Also note that this listen tag can be triggered before <TagLink tag='@onInstJoined'/>. This means that it is possible for bots in other spaces to not be available when this listener is triggered.

#### Arguments:
```typescript
let that: {
    /**
     * The list of tags that were changed on the bot.
     */
    tags: string[]
};
```

### `@[groupName][stateName]OnEnter`

A whisper that is sent whenever the `[groupName]` tag is set to `[stateName]` via the <ActionLink action='changeState(bot, stateName, groupName?)'/> function.

#### Arguments:
```typescript
let that: {
  /**
   * The stateName that the bot is coming from.
   */
  from: string,

  /**
   * The stateName that the bot is going to.
   */
  to: string,
};
```

### `@[groupName][stateName]OnExit`

A whisper that is sent whenever the `[groupName]` tag is changed from `[stateName]` via the <ActionLink action='changeState(bot, stateName, groupName?)'/> function.

#### Arguments:
```typescript
let that: {
  /**
   * The stateName that the bot is coming from.
   */
  from: string,

   * The stateName that the bot is going to.
   */
  to: string,
};
```

### `@onFormAnimationStarted`

#### Arguments:
```typescript
let that: {
    /**
     * The animation that was stopped.
     */
    animation: string | number;
};
```

### `@onFormAnimationLooped`

A whisper that is sent whenever an animation finishes and starts to repeat based on the loop rules given to <ActionLink action='os.startFormAnimation(botOrBots, nameOrIndex, options?)'/> in the options.

#### Arguments:
```typescript
let that: {
    /**
     * The animation that was looped.
     */
    animation: string | number;

    /**
     * The number of loops that have been completed.
     */
    loopCount: number;
};
```

### `@onFormAnimationFinished`

A whisper that is sent whenever an animation that was started by <ActionLink action='os.startFormAnimation(botOrBots, nameOrIndex, options?)'/> stops.
This whisper is sent both for when the animation is manually stopped (by calling <ActionLink action='os.stopFormAnimation(botOrBots, options?)'/>) and also when it stops because it shouldn't repeat.

#### Arguments:

let that: {
    /**

A shout that is sent when the meet portal finishes loading.
Note that when this shout is sent, the user may not actually be in the meeting. They simply be in the meeting waiting area and not actually in the meeting.
If you want notification when the user has become a participant in a meeting, use <TagLink tag='@onMeetEntered'/>.

It is safe to run <ActionLink action='os.meetCommand(command, ...args)'/> after this shout has been received.

#### Arguments:
```typescript
let that: {
    /**
     * The name of the room that the user joined.
     * Note that this may be different from the meetPortal since a meeting can contain several breakout rooms.
     */

     */
    isBreakoutRoom: boolean;
};
```

### `@onMeetExited`

    /**
     * The name of the room that the user exited.
     */

}
```

2. Send a message back to the remote that sent the message.
```typescript
if (that.name === "hello") {
    sendRemoteData(that.remoteId, "hi");
}
```

### `@onRemoteJoined`

A shout that is run on every other remote device when it joins the current server.

Since this shout is run on every device, you should be careful about performing duplicate actions.
When in doubt, elect a remote to perform all actions that should only be executed once.
See example 2 below.

#### Arguments:
```typescript
let that: {
    /**
     * The ID of the remote that joined the server.
     */
    remoteId: string
};
```

#### Examples:

1. Show a toast when a remote joins.
```typescript
os.toast("Remote joined: " + that.remoteId);
```

### `@onRemoteLeave`

A shout that is run on every other remote device when it leaves the current server.

Since this shout is run on every device, you should be careful about performing duplicate actions.
When in doubt, elect a remote to perform all actions that should only be executed once.
See example 2 below.

#### Arguments:
```typescript
let that: {
    /**
     * The ID of the remote that left the server.
     */
    remoteId: string
};
```

#### Examples:

1. Show a toast when a player leaves.
```typescript
os.toast("Remote joined: " + that.remoteId);
```

### `@onAnyBotsAdded`

A shout that is sent when a list of bots is added to the current server.

Unlike <TagLink tag='@onAnyCreate'/>, this listen tag is triggered whenever the bots have been added to the current device's server, even if the bots have already been created.
An example of this happening is when you first load a server. Even though all the bots have already been created, they still need to be added to the server in order for you to interact with them.

Note that this listen tag is triggered after executing scripts have finished running. This means that if a script updates the same tag multiple times, `@onAnyBotsAdded` will still only be triggered once.
This is in contrast to <TagLink tag='@onCreate'/> which is triggered immediately after the bot has been created.

Also note that this listen tag can be triggered before <TagLink tag='@onInstJoined'/>. This means that it is possible for bots in other spaces to not be available when this listener is triggered.

#### Arguments:
```typescript
let that: {
    /**
     * The array of bots that were added to the server.
     */
    bots: Bot[];
};
```

### `@onAnyBotsRemoved`

A shout that is sent when a list of bots is removed from the current server.

Unlike <TagLink tag='@onDestroy'/>, this listen tag is triggered whenever the bots have been removed from the current device's server, even if the bots were not destroyed.
An example of this happening is when another player disconnects. Even though their config bots were not destroyed, they still need to be removed from the server.

Note that this listen tag is triggered after executing scripts have finished running. This means that if a script updates the same tag multiple times, `@onAnyBotsRemoved` will still only be triggered once.
This is in contrast to <TagLink tag='@onCreate'/> which is triggered immediately after the bot has been created.

Also note that this listen tag can be triggered before <TagLink tag='@onInstJoined'/>. This means that it is possible for bots in other spaces to not be available when this listener is triggered.

#### Arguments:
```typescript
let that: {
    /**
     * The array of bot IDs that were removed from the server.
     */
    botIDs: string[];
};
```

### `@onAnyBotsChanged`

A shout that is sent when one or more tags are changed on a list of bots in the current server.

This listen tag is triggered whenever the bots have been updated in the current device's server, even if the bots were not updated locally.
An example of this happening is when another player changes a tag in the sheet portal. Even though the change was made on their device, it will show up on the current device.

Note that this listen tag is triggered after executing scripts have finished running. This means that if a script updates the same tag multiple times, `@onAnyBotsChanged` will still only be triggered once.
This is in contrast to <TagLink tag='@onCreate'/> which is triggered immediately after the bot has been created.

Also note that this listen tag can be triggered before <TagLink tag='@onInstJoined'/>. This means that it is possible for bots in other spaces to not be available when this listener is triggered.

#### Arguments:
```typescript
let that: {
    /**
     * The bot that was updated.
     */
    bot: Bot,

    /**
     * The list of tags that were changed on the bot.
     */
    tags: string[]
}[];
```

### `@onError`

A shout that is sent when an unhandled error occurs in a listen tag.
Errors can occur for many reasons, but common ones include data being unexpectedly missing (e.g. "Cannot read property xyz of undefined") or invalid usage (e.g. "xyz is not a function").

Note that errors which occur in a `@onError` listen tag will not trigger further `onError` calls.
To view those errors, open the developer tools console.

#### Arguments:
```typescript
let that: {
    /**
     * The bot that the error originated from.
     */
    bot: Bot,

    /**
     * The tag that the error originated from.
     */
    tag: string,

    /**
     * The error that occurred.
     */
    error: Error
}
```

### `@onRoomJoined`

     */
    options: {
        /**
