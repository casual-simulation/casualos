Listen tags are tags that can receive shouts and whispers from other bots and actions that happen from the user.

Unlike <TagLink tag='@onCreate'/>, this listen tag is triggered whenever the bot as been added to the current player's story, even if the bot has already been created.
An example of this happening is when you first load a story. Even though all the bots have already been created, they still need to be added to the story in order for you to interact with them.

Note that this listen tag is triggered after any pending scripts have finished running. This means that if a script creates multiple bots, `@onBotAdded` will be triggered after all the bots have been created.

There is no `that` argument for this listen tag.

A whisper that is sent when a tag on the bot is updated.

This listen tag is triggered whenever the bot has been updated in the current player's story, even if the bot was not updated locally.

Note that this listen tag is triggered after any pending scripts have finished running. This means that if a script updates the same tag multiple times, `@onBotChanged` will still only be triggered once.

#### Arguments:
```typescript
let that: {
    /**
     * The list of tags that were changed on the bot.

    tags: string[]
};
```

   * The stateName that the bot is coming from.
   */
  from: string,

  /**
   * The stateName that the bot is going to.
   */
  to: string,
};
```

### `@[groupName][stateName]OnExit`

A whisper that is sent whenever the `[groupName]` tag is changed from `[stateName]` via the <ActionLink action='changeState(bot, stateName, groupName?)'/> function.

if (that.name === "hello") {
    remoteWhisper(that.playerId, "hi");

let that: {
    /**

    });
}
```

### `@onRemotePlayerUnsubscribed`

A shout that is run on every other player when a player leaves the current story.

Since this shout is run on every player, you should be careful about performing duplicate actions.
When in doubt, elect a player to perform all actions that should only be executed once.

#### Arguments:
```typescript
let that: {
    /**

```

### `@onAnyBotsAdded`

A shout that is sent when a list of bots is added to the current story.

An example of this happening is when you first load a story. Even though all the bots have already been created, they still need to be added to the story in order for you to interact with them.

Note that this listen tag is triggered after any pending scripts have finished running. This means that if a script creates multiple bots, `@onAnyBotsAdded` will only be triggered once.

     */

Unlike <TagLink tag='@onDestroy'/>, this listen tag is triggered whenever the bots have been removed from the current player's story, even if the bots were not destroyed.
An example of this happening is when another player disconnects. Even though their player bots were not destroyed, they still need to be removed from the story.

Note that this listen tag is triggered after any pending scripts have finished running. This means that if a script deletes multiple bots, `@onAnyBotsRemoved` will only be triggered once.

#### Arguments:
```typescript
let that: {
    /**
     * The array of bot IDs that were removed from the story.
     */
    botIDs: string[];
};
```

### `@onAnyBotsChanged`

A shout that is sent when one or more tags are changed on a list of bots in the current story.

This listen tag is triggered whenever the bots have been updated in the current player's story, even if the bots were not updated locally.
An example of this happening is when another player changes a tag in the sheet portal. Even though the change was made on their device, it will show up on the current device.

Note that this listen tag is triggered after any pending scripts have finished running. This means that if a script updates multiple bots, `@onAnyBotsChanged` will only be triggered once.

#### Arguments:
```typescript
let that: {
    /**
     * The bot that was updated.
     */
    bot: Bot,

    /**
     * The list of tags that were changed on the bot.
     */
    tags: string[]
}[];
```
