import { TagLink } from '../components.jsx'


Tags are pairs of names and their corresponding values. Each tag lives in a bot and represents an attribute of the bot.
For example if a bot has a tag named `color`, and that tag has the value `blue`, then we would say that bot has `#color` set to `blue`. ("the color tag is set to blue")

In CasualOS, tags are used to store data as well as a way to program automations that respond to user actions.
CasualOS has predefined automations for some tags. We call these tags "built-in tags" and they can be used to quickly decorate bots or control some of their behavior. 
For example, the <TagLink tag='color'/> tag can be used to change the color that a bot is displayed with while the <TagLink tag='label'/> tag can be used to show a text label on a bot.
