A File Record is a piece of information that is stored in a <GlossaryRef term='record'>record</GlossaryRef> and is accessed by a unique URL.
Once uploaded, file records cannot be changed and are publicly available.

File records are most useful for storing heavy data (images, MP3s, etc.) that does not change.
