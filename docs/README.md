# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation

Package installation happens when the `npm run bootstrap` script is run from the root project directory.

### Local Development

```
$ npm run start
```

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

```
$ GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> USE_SSH=true npm run deploy
```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.
